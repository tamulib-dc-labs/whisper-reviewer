WEBVTT

00:01.128 --> 00:01.889
Okay.

00:02.570 --> 00:04.954
Can you focus on what we're supposed to be doing?

00:07.638 --> 00:08.299
I guess.

00:08.800 --> 00:09.120
Okay.

00:09.320 --> 00:09.861
Thank you.

00:10.001 --> 00:10.362
Okay.

00:10.382 --> 00:14.088
Now tell me your name and age again, please.

00:14.809 --> 00:19.776
My name is Felix Jose Alvarez.

00:19.796 --> 00:21.699
I am 68 years old.

00:21.739 --> 00:26.587
I was born in 1951 on March 29th.

00:27.408 --> 00:27.969
Okay.

00:27.989 --> 00:28.890
And where were you born?

00:29.478 --> 00:32.542
McAllen, Texas.

00:32.562 --> 00:33.223
Okay.

00:36.908 --> 00:37.830
Excellent.

00:38.290 --> 00:41.895
All right.

00:43.598 --> 00:47.563
So can you tell me... Let's see.

00:47.723 --> 00:53.011
So when you were... In the late 60s, you were how old?

00:56.115 --> 00:58.438
In the late 60s...

00:59.161 --> 01:04.670
In 1969, I was 18 years old.

01:04.690 --> 01:06.493
1969.

01:08.116 --> 01:21.479
And so do you consider yourself a participant of the Chicano movement?

01:21.499 --> 01:24.544
I consider myself to be a...

01:29.873 --> 01:33.497
A, what do you call it?

01:33.517 --> 01:46.349
I was going to say a leader in the Chicano movement, but I think I'd rather say I was a propagandist for the Chicano movement.

01:46.369 --> 01:47.450
And why do you say that?

01:47.670 --> 01:49.592
Of the Chicano movement.

01:49.612 --> 01:55.678
Because I made a conscious decision

01:57.025 --> 02:11.479
in 1969 to participate as an activist and identifying myself as a Chicano.

02:13.421 --> 02:24.552
And before that, I had considered, I had identified myself as a Tejano Mexicano.

02:28.396 --> 02:57.357
So in 1969, you said you made a conscious choice to identify as a Chicano and to promote and agitate and take this identity to the

02:58.636 --> 03:01.420
Southwest.

03:01.440 --> 03:18.886
And so was the Chicano movement or whatever you decided to join or to make a conscious choice to be a Chicano, was that something that you saw was already kind of like something that had already started and you were joining it?

03:19.167 --> 03:24.174
Or do you see it as something that was like forming when you joined it?

03:24.194 --> 03:27.900
It was forming and it was forming

03:28.640 --> 03:45.305
And it was multifaceted in the sense that there were groups of people in different parts of the U.S.

03:45.486 --> 03:49.973
Southwest who were identifying with it.

03:50.493 --> 03:54.900
And so each one, what I experienced, because I was a part of the

03:55.522 --> 04:24.448
Teatro Campesino, as we traveled around the country organizing through the use of Teatro Chicano, that made us at the forefront of those who were using our vehicle, a cultural vehicle, to promote the idea of Chicanismo to every town and community or city that we traveled.

04:25.070 --> 04:41.332
And we met Raza all the way from Chicago, Illinois, the Midwest, the Southwest, the Northwest, and Texas, Oklahoma, all of that, that whole area.

04:41.352 --> 04:53.288
And what made it, or what made my decision to be a Chicano activist with the Teatro

04:53.993 --> 05:23.140
Campesino was that I had started going to Fresno State University and the Raza that was attending that year, the fall of 1969, everyone that was a part of the Chicano group in Fresno State were from all over

05:23.778 --> 05:42.424
the valley, you know, people from San Jose, people from, uh, Sacramento and me coming from Livingston, which is like about, I don't know, 80 miles or so from Fresno.

05:42.444 --> 05:51.777
And, and so all of us were being, um, we're looking at, at

05:52.297 --> 06:00.728
how we were going to engage our activism.

06:00.929 --> 06:12.925
And I remember at Fresno State, there was a group, Mecha, and I wasn't very interested in becoming a part.

06:12.945 --> 06:13.445
Did you stop?

06:13.486 --> 06:22.017
I wasn't very interested in becoming a part of Mecha because it seemed to me that it was too...

06:23.617 --> 06:46.227
too frivolous or not as engaged or interested in other social justice issues that affected the Chicano or the Raza community.

06:47.228 --> 06:52.695
I remember that the activities that I saw them engaged in, which was mostly

06:54.110 --> 06:58.153
Parties, social stuff.

06:59.294 --> 07:03.638
And so I basically said no to that involvement.

07:04.138 --> 07:24.015
And when I saw the Teatro Campesino performing, I saw them as a more focused or committed beyond, you know, just dressing up and trying to act like they were Chicanos.

07:24.451 --> 07:29.837
but rather that they were doing something about, they were a propaganda group as I saw it.

07:30.658 --> 07:52.602
And I thought, this is something that I want to be, that I could be a real part of because we're going outside of the schools, we're going out in the community, we're going out to other parts, to other communities, and we're telling, the message that we were taking was that people needed to organize, that people needed to

07:53.425 --> 08:04.517
band together and unite against the different institutions that were impacting or affecting Raza communities in a negative way.

08:05.157 --> 08:22.015
So some of these that we identified and that I identified with was what was going on in the schools, anti-war efforts against the Vietnam War, racist,

08:23.362 --> 08:24.223
policies?

08:24.403 --> 08:48.331
Not necessarily policies, but just the racist behavior of the police and individual people that were always taking advantage of Raza and oppressing them with violence and taking advantage of them, taking their land and all of that.

08:48.832 --> 08:49.032
And

08:49.467 --> 09:03.590
The reason that I've had that kind of an awareness or focus was because I grew up in a family where my mother and my grandfather, my maternal grandfather, had always been activists in the familia.

09:03.610 --> 09:06.374
They didn't call themselves Chicanos.

09:06.394 --> 09:16.791
They just saw themselves as a part of the Mexican community that always stood up for the underdog or always stood up for their people, their community.

09:17.277 --> 09:29.594
and didn't allow for institutions or individuals to take advantage of them or take advantage of people in our community.

09:30.235 --> 09:35.583
And that started back in Texas, so I grew up with that.

09:35.603 --> 09:44.095
And when we came to California in 1966, it continued because we saw it all around us.

09:44.530 --> 10:13.305
So when I became part of the Teatro Campesino in 1969, it was very easy for me to become engaged in a group that was standing up, speaking out, going all over the community and the country to try to raise the awareness, the consciousness, the activism of other communities against the way they were being treated.

10:13.606 --> 10:30.894
And so for me, it wasn't about, so becoming Chicano for me meant uniting with other raza people that were beginning to say, hey, you know, we've got to stand up for ourselves.

10:31.976 --> 10:38.787
My difference with the student movement was that it was very short-lived type of movement in the sense that

10:39.357 --> 10:44.185
It appeared that people only got involved in the two years or four years that they were going to college.

10:44.686 --> 10:51.537
After that, they went into the workforce or whatever institution they went into.

10:53.180 --> 11:04.318
They maintained the Chicano awareness and consciousness because they were supporting bigger efforts that were taking place out of the community, like supporting the farm workers.

11:04.670 --> 11:09.096
And that's the teatro, or are you talking about the students?

11:09.116 --> 11:10.378
No, I'm talking about the students.

11:10.398 --> 11:26.500
In other words, there was always an opportunity for students to become engaged in the greater community about social, cultural issues in the Chicano community, and some of them did, but many didn't.

11:26.841 --> 11:30.846
They just were active and involved when they were in school.

11:31.450 --> 11:48.398
And for me, that's part of the attraction that I had with the Teatro Campesino because I saw it not as a temporary organization that was only concerned about the movement or the issues because we were all in college or anything like that.

11:48.999 --> 11:52.885
I saw it as a more permanent institution that was looking

11:53.017 --> 12:19.885
and searching for its own self-independent realization of identity, who we are, where we come from, who our history and our cultural roots were, and then above and beyond that about activism, about what were the things that we could do and organize and implement in our communities to help

12:20.742 --> 12:21.843
our communities.

12:22.644 --> 12:50.260
The one difference I think that I had above a lot of the other people that were involved with the Teatro Campesino was that because I was raised by an activist mom and an activist grandfather, their view of what the struggle was about was not about getting a better job, getting an education,

12:50.813 --> 13:03.872
getting into Hollywood or anything like that, their perspective had a connection directly to the land.

13:03.892 --> 13:10.802
In other words, we lost, we were robbed of a territory that belonged to our community.

13:11.343 --> 13:19.875
And so they, my grandfather always spoke about the United States carpetbaggers that came into Texas and literally

13:20.243 --> 13:23.888
killed Mexicans, robbed their lands, took it over.

13:24.829 --> 13:33.481
And as I got older, I began to realize that that didn't just take place in Texas, but that it took place in New Mexico, in Arizona, in California.

13:34.422 --> 13:48.161
And not only to Mexican people, but to the native people that lived in those regions were not only did they lose their land, but many of them were eliminated.

13:48.281 --> 13:49.963
I mean, there's very, very few

13:50.686 --> 13:53.610
members of their tribes that are left even today.

13:54.771 --> 13:58.236
Um, and so my grandfather always focused on that.

13:58.276 --> 14:08.790
This was all about La Tierra, about, about the, um, getting our, our territories back and fighting back.

14:09.491 --> 14:20.085
So when the concept of Aztlan emerged among us and the idea that, that we are a part of the native people,

14:21.179 --> 14:33.030
of the Southwest, that really enhanced my view of what the Chicano movement, Chicano consciousness was all about.

14:33.090 --> 14:50.325
It was about how do we connect back with all that has been taken from us, and I'm talking about land, I'm talking about cultural ways, I'm talking about wisdom, I'm talking about spiritual beliefs, all of that, because

14:50.727 --> 15:02.880
the major institutions of the United States and of Spanish Mexico was that they did away with our way of life.

15:03.000 --> 15:07.745
I'm literally destroying it, blowing it up, burning it up, and all of that.

15:08.886 --> 15:17.916
And the more I uncovered for myself the truth of

15:18.740 --> 15:22.603
of our reality, the more Chicano I became.

15:24.385 --> 15:47.245
And so because I was involved in this organization that we were looking at our culture, cultural ways, our wisdom, our roots, it just became clearer and clearer to me that I was on the right path, at least in terms of trying to identify

15:48.372 --> 15:50.836
what this Chicano movement was about.

15:50.916 --> 15:53.621
And for me as, as I got older.

15:58.109 --> 16:01.655
Okay.

16:01.775 --> 16:03.057
We're back.

16:03.798 --> 16:08.006
Um, well, this gives me a good opportunity to interject here.

16:08.747 --> 16:10.650
Um, so

16:11.052 --> 16:15.599
I heard a lot of, well, okay, let me start with this.

16:16.941 --> 16:33.747
So you know that my project is about trying to understand the connection or the understanding of mesizaje during the Chicano movement.

16:33.787 --> 16:33.887
Okay.

16:34.255 --> 16:50.302
And I think before I get to that, because there were some interesting things that you had brought up when you were kind of telling your story about why you, you know, you got involved in the movement and the kind of involvement that you got into.

16:52.085 --> 16:58.255
But one thing that you mentioned a couple of times was this idea of Chicanismo and

16:58.724 --> 17:00.887
and Chicano consciousness.

17:01.649 --> 17:10.563
And so I was wondering if you could maybe say a little bit more about like what or how you understand those types of things or those concepts.

17:11.524 --> 17:11.905
Okay.

17:15.611 --> 17:26.368
Let me, I guess what I'm saying, the way that I understood that was one part has to do with the way I was raised.

17:26.686 --> 17:47.187
with my mom and grandfather being able to convey to me part of their resistance to the way of life of Mexicanos Tejanos in Texas and how they were treated by the Anglo and how we responded or how they responded to that.

17:48.389 --> 17:54.415
And it bred in me the consciousness of that

17:54.867 --> 17:58.370
there's something wrong, you know, in, in terms of how we're being treated.

17:58.991 --> 18:03.035
And then here's a historical connections as to why that took place.

18:03.415 --> 18:07.979
So number one is because they stole our homeland.

18:08.099 --> 18:10.081
They stole the land.

18:10.101 --> 18:18.709
They took it by war and they took it by sheer violence and they created a militia that kept that violence.

18:18.729 --> 18:20.091
And that's the Texas Rangers.

18:20.691 --> 18:24.295
So all of this history and background grew up with.

18:24.315 --> 18:24.655
So,

18:25.259 --> 18:35.911
As a teenager, I also felt it directly because I went to schools in Texas where they still practice capital punishment.

18:35.931 --> 18:38.193
Capital punishment.

18:38.213 --> 18:40.035
Not capital punishment.

18:40.456 --> 18:41.557
Corporal punishment.

18:41.577 --> 18:43.259
Corporal punishment.

18:44.320 --> 18:51.368
And I remember that if we spoke Spanish in school,

18:51.466 --> 18:52.908
you would get three swats.

18:52.928 --> 18:59.958
You'd be sent to the principal, and the principal would physically hit you with a board for speaking Spanish.

18:59.978 --> 19:05.045
And I remember growing up in South Texas, speaking Spanish, speaking English.

19:05.205 --> 19:09.071
In my family, we spoke bilingually.

19:09.091 --> 19:13.637
I mean, empezábamos hablar en español, and we would go right into English.

19:13.878 --> 19:16.982
We had no problem communicating that way.

19:17.182 --> 19:20.427
And I grew up in a family where we were able to do that.

19:20.795 --> 19:25.303
So when we were in school as teenagers and stuff, we would always be talking like that.

19:25.323 --> 19:33.537
And we would always get pointed out by our Anglo students and turned in and were beaten.

19:33.557 --> 19:34.498
So I grew up with that.

19:34.518 --> 19:40.749
And I also grew up with my mother being involved in trying to get our community to vote.

19:41.831 --> 19:43.073
And they would always be

19:43.475 --> 19:50.968
uh, turned back at the voting polls because one stupid reason or another, oh, you don't bring your own pencil and you can't do it.

19:51.168 --> 19:52.771
I mean, stupid little shit like that.

19:53.332 --> 19:54.795
So I grew up with all of that.

19:55.676 --> 20:08.318
Uh, and so when I came to California, I continued to see the mistreatment of our community from working in the fields, um,

20:09.530 --> 20:24.010
being paid low wages, no bathrooms, all of that stuff that the farm workers and the Farm Workers Union were fighting for farm workers to have, you know, basic human needs out in the workplace.

20:25.652 --> 20:38.490
And I also saw the brutality of women, farm worker women, with single families being exploited and taken advantage of

20:39.112 --> 20:42.256
by Contratistas and others.

20:42.276 --> 20:45.539
And it never escaped my view.

20:45.579 --> 20:50.745
I always had something in me that said that's not right.

20:51.666 --> 21:00.576
And so when I went to, when I graduated from high school, I went to Fresno and joined the Teatro Campesino.

21:00.616 --> 21:08.325
That seemed to me the perfect vehicle to get the message out, to get these ideas out to the community.

21:08.626 --> 21:19.786
And as a part of doing that, it allowed me the opportunity to do research, which was, we didn't have the internet like you do now.

21:19.806 --> 21:25.015
So, you know, I began to look into the history of

21:25.332 --> 21:48.623
the Texas Rangers, look into the history of education and basically start the process of educating myself to have a better understanding of what I was talking about or that we were all talking about so we could present as much truth against the lies that we were living under because we thought that's the way it was.

21:48.983 --> 21:49.404
Okay.

21:50.265 --> 21:53.449
And when I decided to become Chicano,

21:53.885 --> 22:22.575
from a Tejano-Mexicano identity that I always carried with me was when I saw young students and young raza beginning to call themselves Chicanos and that they were proud of that name and that this was kind of like the unifying name that we were all taking and that we were all trying to

22:23.062 --> 22:24.984
to define or to establish.

22:26.286 --> 22:48.552
And so I gave up my, I didn't give up my Tejano-Mexicano identity, but what I did is I decided that the Chicano identity was the better road to take because it expanded, it expanded the Tejano-Mexicano view or worldview to a bigger worldview.

22:49.152 --> 22:49.313
Okay.

22:50.154 --> 22:51.415
And then when

22:52.542 --> 23:10.867
When Chicanos begin identifying with the idea of Aztlan, which is the land from where the, and the Aztec myth of how they, or story of how they ended up in Mexico City.

23:12.249 --> 23:20.440
When you begin to look at that story about how they came from the north and they went south and they were the outside group coming into Mexico,

23:20.960 --> 23:32.492
a city which was already established, already had pyramids, already had all these other native people living in and around that one geographical area.

23:32.512 --> 23:42.824
And these outsiders came from the north, these new people.

23:44.205 --> 23:50.612
Then it became clear to me that they came from somewhere in the southwest.

23:50.862 --> 24:02.275
And I've always identified over the years, I've always identified that area to be the four corners, like Utah, Arizona, New Mexico, Colorado, that area.

24:03.216 --> 24:14.608
And I've always gone back to that area in pilgrimage to a root area that I think would be comparable to what Aslan is.

24:15.331 --> 24:19.937
But more than that, that it's part of our ancestral root.

24:20.258 --> 24:22.060
It isn't just in Mexico.

24:22.441 --> 24:28.108
It isn't just the Aztecs, the Mayas, the Zapotecs, but that we're one people.

24:28.129 --> 24:29.050
Somos uno.

24:29.931 --> 24:42.368
And that our cultural ways are not very different from people all the way from Alaska or the northern part all the way down to the southern part of Patagonia.

24:42.955 --> 24:49.543
And so that was part of my universal connection to that.

24:49.583 --> 25:00.095
It wasn't about me being Tejano regionalistic or Chicano, but rather that I'm a part of a whole continent and it ain't called America.

25:03.479 --> 25:10.347
But so is that an evolution of thought that you have?

25:10.765 --> 25:18.475
Well, but I mean, so is it an evolution of thought as you have aged and as you have learned more?

25:18.675 --> 25:25.444
So like in 1969, was that your thought or is this something that has progressed since then?

25:26.024 --> 25:34.055
It's progressed since then, but it emerged very quickly from 1968.

25:34.635 --> 25:35.997
Yeah.

25:36.196 --> 25:37.798
to let's say 1973.

25:38.079 --> 25:48.374
And so can I clarify, because the original question was about how you understand Chicanismo, right?

25:49.456 --> 26:00.973
And so what I heard you talk about was being familiar with the history of people from the Southwest, right?

26:01.093 --> 26:04.718
So you called yourself a Tejano Mexicano, right?

26:04.867 --> 26:14.923
And that a lot of what you learned and that a lot of what you learned about being from that area was from your mother and your father.

26:15.524 --> 26:16.445
And their activism.

26:16.505 --> 26:22.635
And their activism there and understanding how things were the way they were.

26:23.016 --> 26:23.276
Right?

26:23.536 --> 26:24.137
Right.

26:24.879 --> 26:32.190
They had a better understanding of the condition that they were living in and under because

26:32.525 --> 26:57.250
they connected they had a connection of historical significance to to the region for hundreds of years in other words they weren't immigrants that just arrived there and like oh what's here you know they they had a history there yeah okay so so okay so relating that back to chicanismo do you see or

26:57.635 --> 27:09.229
Am I understanding that your understanding of Chicanismo has to do with understanding how the history affects the present?

27:12.133 --> 27:13.715
Like, is that part of it?

27:13.795 --> 27:19.862
My development of Chicanismo is that...

27:20.753 --> 27:33.490
the prize, the goal, the mission, the Chicano mission is to take our territories back, our way of life back.

27:34.130 --> 27:44.043
And so the role of Chicanismo is to commit yourself to that endeavor.

27:44.063 --> 27:50.592
It's not about, oh, I'm going to, my goal was to be the first one to go to college,

27:50.993 --> 27:54.138
and get a job and all of that shit.

27:54.178 --> 27:57.623
None of that crap has anything to do with being Chicano.

27:58.184 --> 28:11.425
So kind of like, uh, what you were talking about earlier when you were saying, you know, uh, kind of like a reclamation of not only the territory, but okay.

28:11.725 --> 28:18.115
So, so you had said, well, let me, let me just finish that thought because you had mentioned that you,

28:18.685 --> 28:27.155
You saw it as a reclamation of the territory, the culture, the spirituality, the ways of life, right?

28:30.339 --> 28:41.073
And so you see that as like, that is the mission of Chicanismo is kind of reclaiming those things that had been taken.

28:43.275 --> 28:44.897
Yes, yes.

28:44.917 --> 28:48.642
And what I was going to say is that how that

28:48.824 --> 29:04.988
idea evolved or developed within me was because I was a part of a group, an organization that went around the community, that went around through the Southwest, went into Mexico.

29:05.769 --> 29:11.558
So I got to see communities that I had never connected with.

29:12.600 --> 29:17.066
And what I found in that experience was that we were one.

29:17.287 --> 29:18.088
In other words,

29:19.064 --> 29:48.497
chicanos raza in colorado and seattle didn't matter where they were from we we immediately connected we had connections and part of it too had to do with and i don't know how you want to classify this but it has to do with this value that we've had or not a value uh this experience common experience that we've had which is

29:48.916 --> 30:05.257
that we are like the tribes were, you know, 500, 600 years ago where they, they migrated, they lived here, then they lived there and they migrated to different, to different places.

30:05.918 --> 30:15.430
Well, I became a migrant when my family left Texas and came to California and we were following the crop in near Oregon and

30:15.916 --> 30:25.566
And then when I was a part of the teatro, I saw myself as a migrant because we took our messages and our activism to different communities, people that we'd never met before.

30:26.006 --> 30:29.409
But we were coming with a social consciousness.

30:29.490 --> 30:42.022
It wasn't just about doing a play about no saco nada de la escuela, I don't get anything out of school, or los vendidos, or any of the plays and actos that we did.

30:42.543 --> 30:45.045
What we were doing is we were,

30:45.852 --> 30:50.897
culturally and spiritually connecting with raza all over the place.

30:50.917 --> 30:53.980
They didn't even know what they were watching until they saw us.

30:54.000 --> 30:58.504
And when they saw us, they responded and reacted internally.

31:00.486 --> 31:09.795
In other words, they weren't thinking, and I keep saying this thing, they weren't thinking, oh, let's, our Chicano activism is, let's get Chicanos into Hollywood.

31:09.815 --> 31:14.880
It was never about that, but rather it was about connecting

31:15.468 --> 31:18.753
cultural connections to Raza all over.

31:19.494 --> 31:42.471
And one of the things that I personally discovered in doing this, migrating around with the Teatro, was that many of the communities that were like in Detroit, in Seattle, in Kansas, and da-da-da-da-da, were migrant Tejanos that had traveled the migrant paths, Florida.

31:43.379 --> 31:47.644
picking the fields and all that and leaving raza in all these communities.

31:48.104 --> 31:57.335
And so when I had showed up with a teatro, which was Chicanos from California and myself from Texas, was that I was making better connections.

31:58.796 --> 32:03.081
Because these were my people, kind of a thing.

32:04.062 --> 32:10.990
And so I realized, I said, shoot, this is no different than what

32:11.577 --> 32:21.329
The native, our native ancestors who traveled from the north and went south to Mexico, who were dropping off their people in different parts of Mexico.

32:21.929 --> 32:26.795
And so, so it led me to the awareness of the consciousness that we're one.

32:27.576 --> 32:28.357
Somos uno.

32:28.838 --> 32:36.086
So if I have any concept to promote as a Chicano for over 50 years, is that we're what?

32:36.147 --> 32:36.867
Somos uno.

32:36.887 --> 32:41.533
I don't care where, what part you live in, we're one people.

32:41.648 --> 32:59.184
And the transition is above and beyond that now to include the other regional native people, whether they be Sioux, Hopi, Navajo, MODOK, whatever, Chiricahua.

33:00.926 --> 33:09.394
And irregardless of the historical history that keeps telling people, oh, well, Mexicans killed the natives and da-da-da.

33:09.678 --> 33:14.525
Yeah, Mexicans, when you say Mexicans, you're talking about government.

33:14.545 --> 33:16.328
You're not talking about the actual people.

33:17.189 --> 33:28.446
And all you have to do is look today at the Mexican government, which has been oppressive to native communities in Mexico as well.

33:28.713 --> 33:35.899
So you can't be so simple-minded and say, oh, well, Mexicans are the oppressors too.

33:36.780 --> 33:49.972
You have to cut through all that shit and throw it out and say all of that is part of the mierda, the shit that the Anglo oppressors in the United States placed upon Native people.

33:49.992 --> 33:52.494
Because their policy, U.S.

33:53.115 --> 33:58.720
policy, was eliminate.

33:59.105 --> 34:09.148
So can I ask you about, so we're talking about Chicanismo right now and

34:11.018 --> 34:24.132
Would you say that your view of Chicanismo, like, was that something that you felt other people also had a similar kind of vision of what that was?

34:24.493 --> 34:24.773
Yes.

34:27.195 --> 34:30.859
Or was it like, oh, this is how I view Chicanismo.

34:30.879 --> 34:39.148
No, it was, you know, sometimes I felt like, well, am I the only one thinking this stuff?

34:39.609 --> 34:39.709
Yeah.

34:40.178 --> 34:52.777
And I've always seen the truth or the proof in that no matter where I went, I could have been in Minnesota or New York City for that matter.

34:53.658 --> 35:02.351
And I would always run into similar thinking people in different conditions, but still similar.

35:02.792 --> 35:09.882
I remember I met this young, he was younger than me, young Hopi.

35:11.532 --> 35:16.940
And he was maybe a couple of years younger than me.

35:16.960 --> 35:19.745
And he came and stayed with me in San Juan Bautista.

35:19.825 --> 35:27.277
And he showed me how he cooked beans, frijoles, with chile and all of that.

35:27.297 --> 35:37.152
And I remember appreciating that because that was a way different pot of beans than I had ever tasted.

35:38.043 --> 35:56.190
But we were talking late into the night, and he was saying that he comes from a village in Arizona where the Hopi still live the way they've always lived.

35:56.210 --> 36:06.565
In other words, they don't have any electricity, they don't have any of the modern conveniences, and their Hopi ancestors and elders

36:07.169 --> 36:19.125
told them that the only way to fight Americans, America, and all of this that's happened to the Native world was to not live like a white person.

36:20.106 --> 36:36.147
And that they always talked about a great vision that they've had in their history or in their mythology, saying that people at one time traveled south.

36:36.683 --> 36:56.869
migrated south so they have those migration stories still with them and that one day the people would be migrating back to the north so when i heard him saying that i said we're doing it already it's already happening and so when

36:57.153 --> 37:08.131
So as I went along the communities, I saw the connections in different parts of the country and with different people.

37:08.592 --> 37:11.096
We were all saying the same story, but in different ways.

37:12.618 --> 37:18.488
And the only thing missing was making that connection, saying, hey, we're all Native, all of us.

37:18.508 --> 37:23.937
I don't care whether somebody's trying to measure blood percentage or not.

37:24.338 --> 37:40.596
or that you look too white and you got blue eyes and all of that crap that the system places on the native communities to keep them divided and to keep them from realizing who they are, that we're one people.

37:40.616 --> 37:53.029
And so I remember going as a young teatro guy back in the early seventies, we were performing in New York city and we somehow,

37:54.646 --> 38:03.640
People would, if there wasn't one native person in the audience and he saw what we were doing, what we were seeing, they would come and connect.

38:04.561 --> 38:11.031
It was just, I don't know, I don't know what you would call that process, but it was happening.

38:11.531 --> 38:16.799
And I remember this guy came up and he said, I want to invite you guys to come over to our reservation.

38:17.220 --> 38:19.263
Where is your reservation?

38:19.283 --> 38:23.910
He says, we're up here in, what the hell was the name of it?

38:24.380 --> 38:29.505
I want to say St.

38:29.585 --> 38:30.927
Regis, St.

38:30.947 --> 38:31.608
Regis.

38:32.188 --> 38:35.091
They were, shoot, I can't think right now.

38:35.151 --> 38:44.341
They were, I want to say Onondaga, but I'd have to look up the region for it.

38:44.361 --> 38:53.931
This was a long time ago, but they were publishing a native newspaper in the reservation called Aquasasne Notes.

38:54.417 --> 38:59.183
Okay, that you can research it and they're there.

39:00.044 --> 39:11.617
And so this was a group of Native people from that area that were trying to, that were continuing the Native fight against the U.S.

39:11.657 --> 39:12.078
and all that.

39:12.398 --> 39:14.381
They had their own place.

39:14.781 --> 39:16.503
And so we went over there with them.

39:17.464 --> 39:18.906
And I remember...

39:19.173 --> 39:43.290
We were being talked by one of the elders there, and the thing that connected to me through him was he was talking about how they recorded history, and they had this belt, a beaded belt that represented their political process, like how they governed history.

39:43.760 --> 40:03.070
And he spoke about it and he said that this, that this structure that they had applied back in the, uh, in, you know, four or 500 years ago was the, the five, the Confederate, the Confederation, the Iroquois Confederation.

40:03.090 --> 40:03.431
Okay.

40:03.451 --> 40:04.853
And that's who I was meeting.

40:05.394 --> 40:09.801
And they were saying that Teganahuita,

40:10.979 --> 40:18.072
So I heard all those stories from these guys, and they made connections, or I made connections to, well, Daganahuit is just like Kitzhakot.

40:18.092 --> 40:25.385
He's the guy who brought culture and art and unity and peace and all this kind of stuff.

40:25.405 --> 40:34.761
And how they viewed the political decision process, which was by consensus, wasn't the way it is now.

40:34.781 --> 40:35.282
So...

40:36.612 --> 40:53.849
So this is how I evolved my Chicanismo is by making connections with groups of people that had pieces of what was taken from them and how they made sense to a greater image of what Chicanismo is all about or what it could be.

40:55.170 --> 41:05.860
And then, so the young guy from the Hopis, this guy from the Confederate, what did I say it was called?

41:06.228 --> 41:08.090
Confederacy, Iroquois Confederacy.

41:09.491 --> 41:17.599
And so I've always met people in the last 50 years that were part of that.

41:18.060 --> 41:26.548
When I went to Denver and met Corgi Gonzalez and the Crusade for Justice, they were different.

41:26.568 --> 41:31.813
They were more like paramilitary type.

41:32.080 --> 41:36.467
They were black berets, brown berets, red berets, green berets.

41:37.308 --> 41:43.518
Man, I remember thinking, how funny, these guys got all the rainbow berets.

41:44.199 --> 41:55.196
And we were out there, we performed for them, and then we were out there marching on one of their actions, and they had troops of berets marching up and down the street.

41:56.077 --> 41:58.641
And, of course, they also had gun battles.

41:58.761 --> 41:59.843
I mean, these guys were like,

42:00.818 --> 42:04.002
And they had gun battles with the police at one point.

42:04.222 --> 42:21.423
As a matter of fact, the day that we got there, we were told that we had to stand guard on the second floor with a rifle because they were getting bushwhacked by the police and white races during the night.

42:22.164 --> 42:24.227
And we were staying there that night.

42:24.247 --> 42:28.412
So that happened in Denver and that happened in Crystal City.

42:28.527 --> 42:53.117
where you had Tejanos who now not only were carrying weapons but took over the government the mayor the sheriff and and uh and I was there I remember we arrived in Crystal City and the chief of police came out to meet us and took us around and we stayed at their one of their houses and

42:53.468 --> 43:20.100
we got shot at you're saying the wait so in crystal city you were saying that they were that they had taken over those offices like no no they got elected yeah yeah yeah yeah they were more political right right but they also had to be right and so you know um so that was that in colorado in denver it wasn't like that what they did is they had a

43:20.705 --> 43:22.668
They had bought their own cultural center.

43:22.748 --> 43:23.569
They had a building.

43:23.629 --> 43:25.512
It was an old school, second store.

43:25.793 --> 43:27.054
Two stories or three, I forget.

43:27.856 --> 43:28.777
And they were holding it.

43:29.879 --> 43:29.979
Yeah.

43:29.999 --> 43:36.388
In other words, they were viewing their Chicanismo and their sense of Aslan as this building is ours.

43:36.448 --> 43:37.710
Nobody fucks with us.

43:38.131 --> 43:38.291
Yeah.

43:38.491 --> 43:42.357
Almost like Native people in the reservations where they're saying, hey, we run this.

43:42.377 --> 43:43.118
We control it.

43:43.479 --> 43:43.579
Yeah.

43:43.599 --> 43:46.063
You have no power.

43:46.103 --> 43:47.725
No governing power over us.

43:48.937 --> 43:51.160
And so each got dealt in different ways.

43:51.260 --> 44:03.375
And so the way they got dealt, in Colorado, we heard of several of the Crusade for Justice guys that got murdered, got killed, you know, and all that.

44:04.056 --> 44:08.301
In Crystal City, I don't remember anybody getting shot or killed, but they got voted out.

44:08.842 --> 44:09.382
Right.

44:09.402 --> 44:09.723
Okay.

44:12.266 --> 44:15.129
In California, you didn't have anything like that.

44:15.170 --> 44:17.172
All you had was the farm workers.

44:17.573 --> 44:25.422
movement, which is labor, and they had their 40 acres and they had La Paz, and so they had a compound.

44:25.442 --> 44:43.183
The only other group that was trying to do that was us and the Teatro Campesino by creating a compound, a propagandistic compound in San Juan Bautista that was meant to be a propaganda center to reach out to the whole community.

44:44.204 --> 44:45.285
Instead, it became a

44:46.295 --> 44:46.816
Hollywood.

44:47.056 --> 44:51.181
Acting paradise for actors that want to go to Hollywood.

44:51.201 --> 44:51.761
All right.

44:52.002 --> 44:56.427
So, um, so there wasn't in California, there wasn't anything.

44:57.028 --> 45:09.142
I mean, if Chicanos in California are Mecha is our, that shows you how weak California Chicanos were.

45:10.283 --> 45:13.787
Um, the only thing California has is it's got a few

45:14.948 --> 45:30.628
Chicano politicians, which are neither here nor there, but none of that has anything to do with, with the, the focus of Chicanismo within our community.

45:31.148 --> 45:42.643
What California also had is because of the cultural movement that we started, we were the first Chicano cultural center, Centro Campesino Cultural.

45:43.012 --> 45:47.296
That's what I became a part of, not what it is now or whatever it's become.

45:49.258 --> 45:52.942
And our goal was to do this independently.

45:53.222 --> 46:04.554
We wanted to have our own self-realization place for us to continue to organize, develop, and propagandize.

46:05.515 --> 46:12.782
And many Chicano cultural activists were drawn to

46:13.100 --> 46:21.833
to it, and they still are, but it's so watered down and away from what it was that it no longer serves that purpose.

46:22.354 --> 46:42.904
So when I left Teatro Cam Casino, I left it because I was confronted by Luis Valdez saying that, to put it in a nutshell, basically, and leaving out all the other shit, is he's saying to me, you are no longer

46:43.778 --> 46:56.652
Felix Alvarez is a member of this organization that's trying to build this cultural center to promote Ticanismo and all that, but rather you are now my employee.

46:59.795 --> 47:02.358
And I said, hell no.

47:02.378 --> 47:03.779
I'm not your fucking employee.

47:03.799 --> 47:08.464
I haven't been doing this shit for seven years because you're my boss.

47:08.905 --> 47:09.485
Fuck you.

47:10.507 --> 47:10.967
So

47:11.302 --> 47:13.644
That isn't the true character of a Chicano.

47:13.664 --> 47:22.693
A Chicano is not doing what he does because it's a payoff or because it's about money or getting a job or any of that.

47:23.814 --> 47:37.748
And so once that took place, it was a complete selling out of the original idea of creating the Centro Campesino Cultural, which is what I was involved with.

47:38.048 --> 47:42.413
You know what happened after that, so that's still there going on.

47:43.314 --> 47:56.568
And that seems to be comparable to what I see happening in the universities where you have these, what do you call somebody that went to college and that's their alma mater?

47:57.609 --> 47:58.110
Alumni?

47:58.310 --> 47:58.710
Alumni.

47:59.031 --> 48:04.917
So you see all these Chicano student alumni that were either Mecha, Frente, or whatever the hell they were.

48:05.487 --> 48:11.096
who are now looking at, oh, it's 50 years of student organizing or whatever.

48:12.478 --> 48:17.206
And so that's no different from Luis and the teatro and the cultural shit.

48:17.466 --> 48:20.050
People say, oh, we were doing this 50 years ago.

48:20.692 --> 48:23.035
And now it's not Chicano theater, it's American theater.

48:23.095 --> 48:24.438
We're Americans.

48:24.938 --> 48:26.000
Fuck you.

48:26.020 --> 48:29.065
So would you say that the...

48:30.428 --> 48:40.818
Well, because, I mean, so many... So I'm saying that my chicanismo evolved by the experiences, common experiences that I ran into.

48:42.343 --> 48:42.704
Yes.

48:43.526 --> 48:44.168
Sorry, my mom.

48:44.333 --> 48:59.542
Um, well, so what I was going to say is that it's interesting that you were kind of talking about the different ways that the different regions were enacting their idea of Chicanism, right?

48:59.562 --> 49:01.245
So you talked about like Colorado.

49:01.647 --> 49:06.514
And it was a little more militant and like in Crystal City that it was more political.

49:06.894 --> 49:08.036
And militant.

49:08.056 --> 49:08.997
And militant.

49:09.658 --> 49:22.696
And that in California, like you felt that there was not really anything that had some kind of like unifying type of character aside from maybe the cultural stuff that you were talking about, right?

49:23.317 --> 49:23.477
Exactly.

49:23.497 --> 49:29.325
And so I was wondering because it sounds like...

49:29.491 --> 49:44.738
given, like, some of the other stuff you were talking about with, like, the student movement, like, would you consider maybe that to be another kind of feature of, like, the California or West Coast region was, like, an emphasis on, like, the education?

49:45.339 --> 49:53.694
And then also, if you could say maybe, like, how do you think the, because the Chicano moratorium happened in LA, right?

49:53.714 --> 49:53.794
Yep.

49:54.415 --> 50:00.025
So was that something organized by Californians, or was it organized by everybody?

50:00.807 --> 50:01.528
California.

50:01.849 --> 50:05.395
Okay, Chicano Moratorium, 1970, August.

50:06.537 --> 50:10.124
That spring, we went to Teatro.

50:10.645 --> 50:17.638
We went on a southwestern tour, for lack of a better word.

50:18.462 --> 50:26.572
And we performed through Colorado, New Mexico, Arizona, Texas, and then back.

50:26.592 --> 50:32.659
Part of what stood out for me in that... Another.

50:33.841 --> 50:42.711
Part of what stood out for me in that one, that's the tour where we went to Colorado and I met Corky Gonzalez and all of a sudden telling you about them.

50:42.732 --> 50:42.852
Yeah.

50:43.452 --> 50:48.098
Also Crystal City, but we also went to Tierra Maria.

50:48.398 --> 50:53.225
Reyes Lopez Tijerina and I met him and all of that.

50:53.666 --> 51:12.795
And the difference between those two and Tijerina is that Tijerina, he was focusing his activism on the land, but Spanish, you know, because of the Spanish land rights.

51:12.815 --> 51:13.536
Yeah.

51:13.556 --> 51:14.237
And so

51:16.124 --> 51:23.972
So even that was aligning itself with a Chicano kind of thing, but not really.

51:25.033 --> 51:25.534
You know what I'm saying?

51:26.215 --> 51:27.716
And history played itself out.

51:27.756 --> 51:31.680
The guy became a preacher and who the hell knows what else happened.

51:31.700 --> 51:45.415
But what it did is it helped evolve the view of the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo.

51:45.455 --> 51:45.675
Okay?

51:46.195 --> 51:55.449
So that added another piece to Chicanismo worldview in the sense of here's where the two governments, Mexican government and the U.S.

51:55.509 --> 52:01.078
government undid the community and the people because they sold it out.

52:01.098 --> 52:03.902
I mean, they totally sold it out.

52:03.922 --> 52:13.637
So that's why back in that time, I wrote a play called El Maltratado de Guadalupe Hidalgo, The Mist

52:14.613 --> 52:21.103
treatment of the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, but maltratado means bad treaty.

52:21.123 --> 52:21.363
Okay.

52:21.964 --> 52:25.249
And so I don't know, do you ever hear about that?

52:26.010 --> 52:26.070
No.

52:26.090 --> 52:32.439
So in that play, I had Bernadette as my main actress in that play.

52:33.120 --> 52:35.404
She played a saguaro cactus.

52:36.065 --> 52:36.325
Okay.

52:36.385 --> 52:40.010
I built a saguaro cactus out of paper mache and she was in it.

52:40.772 --> 52:43.776
So my concept, my idea concept here was

52:44.887 --> 52:58.425
Uh, and I got this from the Iroquois when I met them because they spoke of the great tree of life and that all the people are around the tree and everybody sees what they see from their perspective, but it's still the same tree.

52:59.206 --> 52:59.307
Yeah.

52:59.327 --> 53:02.491
And that the tree of life is basically part of the history.

53:02.511 --> 53:07.518
So I decided to, to stretch that to, well, the Southwest, it's a cactus.

53:08.799 --> 53:12.244
So the cactus has been sitting here for hundreds of years.

53:12.511 --> 53:16.056
looking at everything that happens in its purview.

53:16.757 --> 53:24.247
So the narrator and storyteller of this story is the cactus and Bernadette was in it.

53:24.267 --> 53:38.586
But basically it tells the story of the westward expansion of the Gringos into the west and into California, the gold rush, making Mexicanos into bandits and how they took

53:39.106 --> 54:07.813
cultural stuff and made it and and appropriated it from mi casas tu casa so i have a scene where i said the mexicanos are welcoming these settlers are coming in they're oh mi casas tu casa and you got water and the guy goes what did he say he said his land is your land hey that sounds like a good idea and he grabs it goes takes it over so using comedy but at the same time

54:08.114 --> 54:09.956
showing that this is what took place.

54:10.477 --> 54:36.045
They basically came in and they took over native land including Mexicans and so Tijerina was with the land-grant movement, the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, Texas was with taking over La Raza Unida party, political party and

54:36.363 --> 54:45.056
And Colorado was with Chicano nationalism as a nation.

54:45.076 --> 54:45.176
Okay.

54:45.196 --> 54:47.239
That was their thing.

54:47.259 --> 54:50.484
So I took all of that.

54:51.265 --> 55:01.660
And then you got California with basically cultural poets, artists, writers, academics.

55:02.321 --> 55:03.763
Okay.

55:03.783 --> 55:04.564
I never,

55:05.708 --> 55:08.250
I never associated with the academics.

55:08.871 --> 55:16.257
I just had this thing for, because all I saw was they'd go there, they'd get brainwashed at the college and then they would sell out.

55:18.159 --> 55:20.161
Better that I get it than somebody else.

55:20.201 --> 55:23.224
They had no backbone, no backbone.

55:23.384 --> 55:25.265
Even today, look at San Jose State.

55:25.546 --> 55:29.609
They got fucking Blanca Alvarado in a meeting, what, two days ago.

55:30.030 --> 55:31.751
She's the Chicano leader.

55:32.612 --> 55:35.074
Bullshit.

55:35.982 --> 55:45.975
And here's California again with their stupid-ass mecha crap that they're doing.

55:46.756 --> 55:51.523
But to me, all of that doesn't matter because it's not real.

55:52.404 --> 56:03.238
It's their own little drama stuff to keep control or focus of

56:04.197 --> 56:10.627
of the university environment so that they can keep their jobs and keep on teaching and all of that.

56:10.667 --> 56:12.269
It's like a self-serving thing.

56:12.289 --> 56:15.914
It's like Luis and the Teatro just, you know, doing their little thing there.

56:17.797 --> 56:33.681
This is like a side question, not really related to what I wanted to talk about, but do you think, like, it's somewhat, like, is that something to be expected, the state of, like,

56:34.150 --> 56:47.663
the Chicano academia today, given that, like, what you were talking about, you know, how California didn't really have its own thing aside from the cultural performative, right?

56:47.723 --> 56:51.287
The artistic, literary, performative aspect.

56:51.647 --> 56:55.311
That would then become, like, the consequence of that?

56:55.932 --> 56:58.254
California had the UFW.

56:58.294 --> 56:59.275
Labor, farm labor.

56:59.295 --> 57:00.516
That's their movement.

57:00.536 --> 57:01.197
Yeah.

57:01.217 --> 57:01.457
Okay.

57:01.741 --> 57:10.873
And the students and the artists and all those other Chicanos, their connection to the movement is, oh, we were with Cesar.

57:12.495 --> 57:16.319
Yes, I have a Welga flag.

57:16.339 --> 57:21.726
But that, I mean, that goes back into that kind of question about like the performance, right?

57:21.746 --> 57:22.187
Yeah.

57:22.707 --> 57:26.713
And that comes out of the teatro too, because who the hell was it promoting?

57:27.213 --> 57:30.297
So I'm realizing now that I'm,

57:30.715 --> 57:36.301
Thinking about this and looking back at it that I wasn't like those other Chicanos in El Teatro.

57:36.562 --> 57:37.423
Yeah.

57:37.443 --> 57:37.823
At all.

57:41.908 --> 57:46.252
Because if I was, I would have been over there with Kiki performing in Hollywood.

57:46.673 --> 57:47.534
Yeah.

57:47.554 --> 57:49.176
And I wouldn't.

57:49.196 --> 57:49.396
Yeah.

57:52.379 --> 57:53.240
What were we talking about?

57:53.260 --> 57:54.662
Oh, the Chicano Moratorium.

57:54.922 --> 57:55.503
Oh, yeah.

57:55.523 --> 57:56.704
Let me get to the Chicano Moratorium.

57:56.724 --> 57:57.465
Okay, okay, okay.

57:59.133 --> 58:23.827
I got a little bit off of that only because what happened in that Southwest tour of 1970, which was before the moratorium, is that as we went out, we took an acto that we had just put together for the Chicano moratorium called Vietnam Campesino, which talked about the U.S.

58:25.089 --> 58:28.093
agricultural and military

58:29.440 --> 58:32.724
complex or whatever you want to call it.

58:32.744 --> 58:33.125
Industrial complex.

58:33.145 --> 58:34.507
Yes.

58:34.527 --> 58:50.747
And that at one point during the Vietnam War, the army, the military was buying all the scab, lettuce, and grapes from the growers to undo the grape strike and all of that.

58:50.767 --> 58:50.868
Yeah.

58:50.888 --> 58:52.189
So they were in cahoots.

58:53.010 --> 58:58.958
So when we saw that, part of our... So we decided to do this act of Vietnam Campesino.

58:59.360 --> 59:02.584
to show how the U.S.

59:02.644 --> 59:18.642
military agriculture complex was helping out growers by taking and buying all this shit and how they were affecting the farm workers in California, but then how they were napalming and affecting the campesino, the poor Vietnamese campesino.

59:19.302 --> 59:24.909
And they were using Chicanos as soldiers to go do it.

59:25.449 --> 59:28.793
And that's kind of like the whole focus of that acto.

59:29.347 --> 59:43.148
And so when we went on this tour, we were the propaganda arm, our own self propaganda arm.

59:43.168 --> 59:47.274
Nobody said, oh, can Teatro be the propaganda arm of the Chicano Moratorium?

59:47.435 --> 59:47.615
No.

59:48.156 --> 59:49.698
We just knew what to do.

59:50.700 --> 59:58.071
So we went on this tour, and every town that we went to, we're telling them, August 29th, we're going to have a

59:58.675 --> 01:00:01.479
Massive marcha in Los Angeles.

01:00:01.840 --> 01:00:04.564
You need to come.

01:00:04.584 --> 01:00:08.970
So Denver, New Mexico, Arizona, Texas.

01:00:10.453 --> 01:00:13.277
And I think that's why we got so many people from everywhere.

01:00:13.958 --> 01:00:15.240
Because we were the only ones doing it.

01:00:15.260 --> 01:00:16.161
We didn't have internet.

01:00:16.181 --> 01:00:18.344
We didn't have people on phones calling.

01:00:18.364 --> 01:00:20.948
We didn't have Facebook or Twitter.

01:00:21.669 --> 01:00:24.133
So we did that.

01:00:26.056 --> 01:00:26.877
And...

01:00:27.903 --> 01:00:30.908
And thousands showed up.

01:00:30.928 --> 01:00:52.100
And we were there in the middle of this because not only were we protesting the killing of Chicanos in the Vietnam War and protesting against it, but people were also advocating for education, for all these different other issues.

01:00:52.761 --> 01:00:54.143
And that's what that marcha became.

01:00:54.183 --> 01:00:56.627
It became a rallying point

01:00:57.012 --> 01:01:00.095
for all these things.

01:01:00.115 --> 01:01:08.483
And we were in Fresno, getting ready to drive down there, and everybody was going in different cars.

01:01:09.404 --> 01:01:15.189
And I remember I went with Phil in his car, and I took my brother Carlos with me.

01:01:15.770 --> 01:01:16.991
He was only like 16.

01:01:18.793 --> 01:01:24.218
And we got in the car, and then just before we took off from Fresno, one of the

01:01:26.915 --> 01:01:36.829
Phil says, oh, I've got to stop over at the Brown Beret office because they want to know if we can carry some stuff in our trunk.

01:01:38.191 --> 01:01:39.612
Okay, so we drive over there.

01:01:40.073 --> 01:01:43.298
And Phil is, are you talking about Phil Esparza?

01:01:43.358 --> 01:01:43.598
Yeah.

01:01:44.679 --> 01:01:52.310
He and I became friends when I first went to Fresno and that's how I ended up becoming a part of the theater because he took me to the place.

01:01:52.811 --> 01:01:56.736
So anyway, open up the trunk and here come the Brown Beret's

01:01:57.239 --> 01:02:03.529
with duffel bags full of rifles and guns.

01:02:03.549 --> 01:02:04.791
I mean, weapons.

01:02:04.811 --> 01:02:05.893
I said, holy shit.

01:02:06.574 --> 01:02:10.260
So we put them in there and Phil's like .

01:02:10.280 --> 01:02:11.543
You didn't know what they were breaking.

01:02:12.304 --> 01:02:15.329
We closed the thing and now we're headed to LA.

01:02:16.290 --> 01:02:23.382
And so it turns out that they were going there to

01:02:24.205 --> 01:02:29.512
be the protectors, the defenders or whatever, but they were taking real good.

01:02:29.532 --> 01:02:45.152
And so anyway, before we get there, I'm already, you know, thinking ahead and going, oh, shit, this is going to be, this is going to be a slaughter of Raza, not them.

01:02:46.113 --> 01:02:50.219
And I, and I, so I had a pre, what, a premonition?

01:02:50.359 --> 01:02:51.140
Premonition.

01:02:51.941 --> 01:02:53.503
So anyway, we get there and

01:02:53.905 --> 01:02:59.893
The park is getting full of people, and Brown Berets are all around the perimeter, you know, doing their thing.

01:03:00.995 --> 01:03:08.024
And so I don't know where the guns ended up, but I was over there by the stage area with my brother, and we're getting ready to go on.

01:03:08.946 --> 01:03:15.515
We're going to do a couple of songs and some actos when shit starts breaking out at the corner.

01:03:15.815 --> 01:03:22.444
We're here on the stage, and that corner, we start seeing, ah, look like a goddamn...

01:03:22.863 --> 01:03:26.068
you know, those battles where people are just .

01:03:26.088 --> 01:03:36.084
And it was starting there, and they were shooting canisters of gas into the crowd, toward the stage, everywhere, just .

01:03:36.104 --> 01:03:37.005
It was all out battle.

01:03:38.187 --> 01:03:43.355
And I turn around like this, looking for Carlos, and he's not there.

01:03:44.016 --> 01:03:45.258
He's gone.

01:03:45.278 --> 01:03:48.804
So I'm looking for him, and everybody's running away.

01:03:49.605 --> 01:03:49.765
Yeah.

01:03:50.268 --> 01:03:53.833
And I'm looking for my brother, and I can't find him, so I go into the middle of the thing.

01:03:54.815 --> 01:03:59.081
And way over there at the front, what's happening, automatic organization.

01:03:59.782 --> 01:04:15.465
People, men, are all hooking up arms and making a barrier, a wall, to keep the police from getting through and getting to the kids and the women and everybody else that was there, old ladies, grandma, didn't give a shit.

01:04:16.205 --> 01:04:25.255
So there's one, two, three, there's like three or four lines like this, all vatos just getting like that.

01:04:25.275 --> 01:04:26.677
Because they don't have weapons.

01:04:26.697 --> 01:04:30.962
So I look over there and I see Carlos.

01:04:30.982 --> 01:04:32.163
He's in the first.

01:04:33.024 --> 01:04:38.009
And he's standing there like that.

01:04:39.171 --> 01:04:42.955
And I see one of them goes over there and boom, whacks him.

01:04:43.441 --> 01:04:46.565
And so, man, I just made a beeline for him.

01:04:46.605 --> 01:04:48.047
I didn't give a shit about anything.

01:04:48.127 --> 01:04:50.870
Just... And got him.

01:04:51.531 --> 01:04:54.034
And we're... I was trying to get him out of there.

01:04:54.395 --> 01:04:55.236
Let's get out of here.

01:04:55.336 --> 01:04:55.776
Let's go.

01:04:55.917 --> 01:04:56.017
Boom.

01:04:56.037 --> 01:04:57.078
I didn't even know where to go.

01:04:57.479 --> 01:04:58.039
I didn't know L.A.

01:04:59.461 --> 01:05:04.027
So... I remember I got tripped up or knocked down.

01:05:04.067 --> 01:05:04.908
And I'm on the floor.

01:05:05.068 --> 01:05:09.133
And this cop with a riot helmet and everything comes over.

01:05:09.173 --> 01:05:10.235
And he's about to hit me.

01:05:11.897 --> 01:05:12.958
And this other Chicano...

01:05:14.255 --> 01:05:20.763
out of nowhere with one of those jumbo quarts of beer.

01:05:21.204 --> 01:05:22.966
Yeah.

01:05:22.986 --> 01:05:23.827
And the cops.

01:05:23.847 --> 01:05:24.929
Yeah, knocks them out.

01:05:25.990 --> 01:05:31.297
And so I get up and grab my brother and head out to the exterior perimeter.

01:05:32.018 --> 01:05:35.202
And then we're just, we got maced the whole thing.

01:05:35.242 --> 01:05:43.553
There's this little old lady in her yard throwing water on people and she's, so we went through all of that and we're ducking

01:05:44.107 --> 01:05:45.088
Rocks, brakes.

01:05:45.168 --> 01:05:46.950
I mean, it's total mayhem.

01:05:48.632 --> 01:05:50.454
Cars are getting overturned, burned.

01:05:50.954 --> 01:05:52.256
Police cars, everything.

01:05:52.316 --> 01:05:53.677
Police are zipping through there.

01:05:54.658 --> 01:06:03.388
And then we end up, finally, after three or four hours of this, we end up all exhausted, sitting in a corner street.

01:06:05.550 --> 01:06:11.597
And this Volkswagen bug, not bug, van, drives up to us, and there's two girls in there.

01:06:12.798 --> 01:06:13.759
Where are you guys from?

01:06:14.110 --> 01:06:18.356
So we're from Fresno, and we've lost our people.

01:06:18.957 --> 01:06:20.820
Jump in, we'll take you to a safe house.

01:06:21.521 --> 01:06:22.102
So we jump in.

01:06:22.723 --> 01:06:23.905
Yeah, they were rescuing people.

01:06:24.686 --> 01:06:38.386
So we ended up at their house, and it was UCLA Ballet Folklórico girls in their house.

01:06:38.406 --> 01:06:42.092
So we ended up staying there that night, and...

01:06:42.207 --> 01:06:50.137
That night, as we were waiting, we were trying to find out if we could find somebody that was going back to Fresno, hitch a ride back.

01:06:50.157 --> 01:06:59.850
But that night, we were at their house, and the girls said, oh, we're all going over to the something, some club.

01:07:01.031 --> 01:07:05.637
And I said, and they were saying, yeah, come with us, blah, blah, blah.

01:07:05.657 --> 01:07:08.601
We go there, and who's performing at this rinky-dink club?

01:07:08.842 --> 01:07:11.385
El Chicano.

01:07:11.405 --> 01:07:11.505
What?

01:07:12.616 --> 01:07:13.637
That's what it was.

01:07:13.658 --> 01:07:15.580
They were just performing in some bar.

01:07:15.921 --> 01:07:17.163
Who is El Chicano?

01:07:17.183 --> 01:07:18.905
You don't know who El Chicano is?

01:07:19.125 --> 01:07:19.566
No.

01:07:20.367 --> 01:07:21.469
It's a Chicano rock band.

01:07:22.230 --> 01:07:23.291
I'll play you some of their music.

01:07:24.914 --> 01:07:29.020
So anyway, the next morning, and we stayed there with them that night.

01:07:29.040 --> 01:07:33.066
And then the next day, we got a ride.

01:07:34.488 --> 01:07:37.232
Somebody that was going back to Fresno.

01:07:37.732 --> 01:07:39.535
And it turned out to be Richard.

01:07:41.405 --> 01:07:43.409
Shit, I can't think of the guy's last name right now.

01:07:44.130 --> 01:07:45.652
Richard Duran.

01:07:45.672 --> 01:07:46.895
Ricardo Duran.

01:07:47.135 --> 01:07:47.896
No number Richard.

01:07:47.916 --> 01:07:50.421
It's not Ricardo Duran.

01:07:50.441 --> 01:07:54.909
And so we hitch a ride with him, and he takes us back to Fresno, and then we get back home.

01:07:55.450 --> 01:07:58.154
Everybody from the theater is already back in Fresno.

01:07:58.174 --> 01:07:59.717
We were wondering what happened to you.

01:08:04.118 --> 01:08:29.535
abandoned and um so anyway so so the chicano moratorium then became the chicano moratorium because of all of that shit that happened yeah but the background was that i was a part of an organized effort that the only organized effort that went out and promoted it to communities outside of california through the theater um

01:08:32.975 --> 01:08:43.753
That is also the tour, 1970, where we were performing in Tierra Maria in this little, I don't know if it was a church or a little school.

01:08:45.376 --> 01:08:52.628
And at the end of the performance, we ended up, because this is how we traveled, we said, anybody have room for us to stay?

01:08:52.728 --> 01:08:54.771
We can sleep on the floor or whatever, you know?

01:08:55.492 --> 01:08:58.257
And so this guy gets up and goes, I can take six of you.

01:08:59.198 --> 01:09:01.001
Was it Dennis Hopper?

01:09:01.021 --> 01:09:01.662
Yep.

01:09:01.682 --> 01:09:02.423
Dennis Hopper.

01:09:03.224 --> 01:09:07.490
So we ended up staying with Dennis Hopper like for three or four days at his hacienda.

01:09:09.634 --> 01:09:10.775
With his personal cook.

01:09:10.795 --> 01:09:19.148
I always had all these opposite contrasts through all this stuff.

01:09:19.168 --> 01:09:19.268
Yeah.

01:09:19.288 --> 01:09:28.682
But what I learned from the people there in Tierra Maria in New Mexico with the Dennis Hoppers and all that is that the local Mexicano community

01:09:29.253 --> 01:09:46.401
was feeling oppressed, exploited, and their stuff being appropriated because they were being invaded by white hippies.

01:09:46.567 --> 01:09:49.150
Like Dennis Hopper?

01:09:49.731 --> 01:09:49.971
Yeah.

01:09:49.991 --> 01:09:53.235
By setting up their little communes and all of that.

01:09:53.495 --> 01:09:53.835
Yeah.

01:09:54.516 --> 01:09:58.040
And just affecting their way of being, their way of life.

01:09:58.801 --> 01:09:59.502
So I remember that.

01:09:59.662 --> 01:10:02.265
That also added to my sense of Chigarismo.

01:10:04.187 --> 01:10:09.253
Can I ask you about, you know the term Reconquista, right?

01:10:09.273 --> 01:10:09.373
Yeah.

01:10:10.014 --> 01:10:13.097
Would you say, because I know you had mentioned that

01:10:13.567 --> 01:10:25.566
For you, you felt like part of what you understood as Chicanismo was a reclamation of territory, culture, spirituality, ways of life, ways of knowing.

01:10:25.586 --> 01:10:29.712
Would you lump that in with that idea of Reconquista?

01:10:29.732 --> 01:10:36.824
Yeah, that's Chicanos at their most nationalist perspective.

01:10:37.324 --> 01:10:37.785
In other words,

01:10:38.508 --> 01:10:43.295
They don't go beyond the, hey, this is our land, fuck you, get out.

01:10:43.315 --> 01:10:43.556
Yeah.

01:10:43.576 --> 01:10:45.399
I mean, there's that group out there, too.

01:10:46.200 --> 01:10:46.360
Yeah.

01:10:46.380 --> 01:10:46.480
Okay?

01:10:47.902 --> 01:10:55.835
And so they organized the Marcha de la Reconquista from the border all the way to Sacramento.

01:10:55.855 --> 01:10:56.956
And they went through Livingston.

01:10:57.016 --> 01:10:59.660
As a matter of fact, they stayed in Livingston overnight.

01:11:01.583 --> 01:11:02.224
When was that?

01:11:03.166 --> 01:11:05.089
1970-something.

01:11:05.169 --> 01:11:06.591
I don't remember the year.

01:11:06.925 --> 01:11:08.427
I mean, you could probably look it up.

01:11:08.527 --> 01:11:14.072
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:11:14.092 --> 01:11:20.379
So your grandmother actually got involved in some of that because she helped coordinate their stay there and all that in Livingston.

01:11:20.899 --> 01:11:28.427
But she was also a part of the Degana Huida Quetzalcoatl University and the takeover of that naval station.

01:11:29.248 --> 01:11:30.529
Over by Davis?

01:11:31.090 --> 01:11:31.330
Yep.

01:11:31.350 --> 01:11:32.511
And she was a part of the...

01:11:33.284 --> 01:11:35.107
occupiers.

01:11:35.127 --> 01:11:42.237
And she was viewed as the Chicana spokesperson for that, for that group.

01:11:43.499 --> 01:11:46.363
The native spokesperson was somebody else.

01:11:46.383 --> 01:11:47.986
Yeah.

01:11:48.006 --> 01:11:48.106
Okay.

01:11:48.226 --> 01:11:54.095
And then let me ask you about the idea of Aslan, right?

01:11:55.417 --> 01:11:58.161
Because you had mentioned earlier that

01:11:58.647 --> 01:12:05.074
you know, oh, I had understood or, like, I learned about this story, right?

01:12:05.674 --> 01:12:10.399
Whether from, like, other communities that you had interacted with.

01:12:11.761 --> 01:12:22.592
And so I was kind of wondering, or actually what you said was that you had found out that they had similar kind of stories, right?

01:12:22.672 --> 01:12:28.138
Or stories that, like, kind of corroborated things that you had already heard about.

01:12:28.338 --> 01:12:28.418
BBs.

01:12:28.870 --> 01:12:33.077
Histories, stories, cultural practices.

01:12:33.318 --> 01:12:40.170
Yeah, so what I wanted to know was where did you first learn about that?

01:12:41.472 --> 01:12:43.256
Of that idea?

01:12:43.636 --> 01:12:49.727
Yeah, that idea of Aslan or that there were people from a certain area that migrated.

01:12:50.368 --> 01:12:52.452
I learned about it.

01:12:53.313 --> 01:12:54.836
I think that's Chewy.

01:12:54.856 --> 01:12:55.758
Hold on.

01:12:55.778 --> 01:12:56.058
Where?

01:12:56.780 --> 01:12:57.561
I think he's gone.
