WEBVTT

00:00.098 --> 00:20.959
the answers it's all right you don't need to there's no right or wrong here so this is my interview with Lupe Olguin you go by Lupe not Guadalupe right I signed Guadalupe Olguin okay so maybe you can tell us

00:21.142 --> 00:24.485
your name and your age or your birth date?

00:25.366 --> 00:30.811
Yeah, my name is Guadalupe Elguin Lupe, and I was born on December 12, 1946.

00:30.931 --> 00:37.417
I'm 72.8 months old.

00:41.000 --> 00:42.442
I was born in L.A.

00:42.462 --> 00:44.904
County, but I grew up in Fresno.

00:45.444 --> 00:46.145
Oh, good, good.

00:46.225 --> 00:50.389
Yeah, I was just going to ask you where you were born, where you, you know, kind of grew up.

00:50.656 --> 00:52.499
but most of your childhood.

00:52.579 --> 00:53.600
I grew up here in prison.

00:54.522 --> 00:54.882
Okay.

00:55.803 --> 01:01.351
And then, um, so this project really has just kind of like two main questions.

01:01.432 --> 01:09.223
And from those two main questions, I, um, they, it ends up, you know, bringing up a whole bunch of other questions.

01:09.804 --> 01:09.904
Yeah.

01:09.924 --> 01:13.609
So the first main question that I have is, um,

01:16.846 --> 01:26.761
What is your connection to the Chicano movement and do you see yourself as a participant of the Chicano movement?

01:26.782 --> 01:27.523
My connection?

01:28.524 --> 01:43.748
Well, I became connected with the Chicano movement in 1969 when I joined the Teatro Campesino with Luis Valdez and the group here in Fresno.

01:44.268 --> 01:55.747
That was an eye opener for me as far as immigrants, as far as Chicanismo, as far as politics.

01:55.907 --> 02:03.019
I mean, it was just a world of new information that I had never really

02:03.202 --> 02:04.463
paid too much attention to.

02:04.543 --> 02:08.527
And if I did, I didn't know where to go to find out more about it.

02:08.547 --> 02:18.837
So I became involved and became a member of the Teatro 1969 and also became a member of the Brown Berets in 1969.

02:18.857 --> 02:21.560
Oh, okay.

02:21.580 --> 02:30.228
So how did you, you said that you, you joined Teatro Campesino in 69 here in Fresno.

02:30.689 --> 02:32.230
What was the,

02:32.581 --> 02:34.264
Like, how did that all come about?

02:37.630 --> 02:40.695
Well, let me see.

02:40.795 --> 02:55.922
I had just come back from staying, living with an aunt in Sacramento, and I voluntarily went to go work out there on the tomato machine for the season, and I ended up staying, and I experienced a...

02:55.902 --> 03:02.833
a Migra raid over there in West Sacramento, which was pretty interesting, you know.

03:03.454 --> 03:14.210
And so I stayed and lullagagged around and then something happened here at the house and so it was time to come back.

03:14.811 --> 03:19.378
And when I came back, I was restless.

03:20.877 --> 03:33.595
I had been, prior to that, I had tried to get into the Vista Volunteers, and they threw me out because I couldn't get along with people, according to them.

03:33.615 --> 03:35.038
What is the Vista Volunteers?

03:35.058 --> 03:39.184
Vista Volunteers is the Domestic Peace Corps.

03:39.804 --> 03:40.245
Oh, okay.

03:40.265 --> 03:40.586
Okay.

03:41.247 --> 03:44.451
And I was stationed in Ogden, Utah.

03:44.471 --> 03:47.796
Well, apparently...

03:49.177 --> 03:51.579
I guess they didn't like my methodology or whatever it was.

03:51.699 --> 03:52.140
I don't know.

03:52.400 --> 03:53.061
I really, you know.

03:54.182 --> 04:00.408
Anyway, I came back and then right after that is when I went to live with my aunt for the year.

04:01.409 --> 04:02.249
In Sacramento?

04:02.269 --> 04:03.150
In Sacramento.

04:03.651 --> 04:13.140
And I stayed there and then I came back to Fresno and I was restless, you know, because I didn't want to stay at the house and basically do nothing.

04:13.240 --> 04:18.525
I mean, you know, I wasn't looking for anybody to settle down with and

04:19.012 --> 04:23.277
all that good domestication type stuff.

04:23.858 --> 04:40.598
So then I was out and about and I heard about this Teatro Campesino and so I went and dropped in, it was at a church, and so I went in and I heard music there.

04:40.578 --> 04:49.593
And it was Daniel Valdez and he was sitting on the stage and he caught my attention because he sounded a lot like Jose Feliciano.

04:49.613 --> 04:54.361
And so I sat down and I listened to him and I just kept on going back.

04:55.062 --> 04:58.047
And some of the people there, you know, started talking to me and stuff.

04:58.929 --> 05:04.037
And the more I heard and the more I listened, the more I saw, the more I...

05:04.017 --> 05:06.603
I was curious and the more I wanted to know.

05:07.305 --> 05:17.569
So Lupe Valdez wasn't married to Luis at the time, but she kind of took me under her wing and she helped to get me into the Teatro Campesino.

05:17.990 --> 05:20.777
And I worked there as a backstage manager.

05:20.977 --> 05:36.038
When we went out on trips, I would load up this trunk that we had with all the props and stuff as much as would fit and just make sure that everything was ready to go for all the octos that they were going to do that day.

05:36.479 --> 05:43.609
I wasn't on the stage because I have stage fright, so that wasn't me.

05:43.589 --> 05:47.919
But I did, you know, a lot better backstage.

05:47.979 --> 05:51.707
So I traveled with them during that time.

05:51.968 --> 05:56.298
And it was during that time that I started collecting buttons from all the places that I went to.

05:56.759 --> 05:58.903
So my first button that I collected was in 1969.

05:59.044 --> 06:01.429
It's 50 years old this year.

06:01.409 --> 06:02.571
Wow.

06:02.591 --> 06:04.193
I've got several of them.

06:04.213 --> 06:11.242
So when you said you traveled with him, are you talking about like their tours to the Southwest and stuff like that?

06:11.262 --> 06:15.127
Well, not necessarily the Southwest, just basically here in California.

06:15.147 --> 06:15.468
Oh, okay.

06:15.488 --> 06:29.847
We went to all the universities, well, not all the universities, but many universities, colleges, junior colleges, and from down south to...

06:30.434 --> 06:36.268
The Bay Area, I don't think I went much further than the Bay Area, Berkeley and all that.

06:36.468 --> 06:37.932
And everything in between.

06:38.974 --> 06:42.182
And everywhere I went, if there was a button, I got it.

06:42.668 --> 06:49.978
And got to meet a lot of people and got a lot of experience about impromptus and stuff like that.

06:49.998 --> 06:52.001
And it was just a whole bunch of fun.

06:52.181 --> 07:03.978
And it was an eye-opener about Chicanismo, about politics, and white people didn't like Chicano power and stuff like that.

07:04.138 --> 07:06.682
And they'd rather be Hispanic than not.

07:07.123 --> 07:10.988
And just people...

07:11.997 --> 07:18.366
having somewhat of a narrow scope of who they were.

07:19.207 --> 07:22.652
You're talking about Chicanos or Mexican-Americans?

07:23.593 --> 07:27.979
Mexican-Americans and Hispanics, basically.

07:28.420 --> 07:30.763
More Hispanic than Mexican-Americans.

07:30.783 --> 07:41.278
When I was in the Brown Berets, one of the things that my leader always drilled into us was that in every Mexican-American there's a potential Chicano.

07:41.512 --> 07:46.360
And so that was our motto there.

07:47.182 --> 07:49.105
So can I ask you a couple of things?

07:50.387 --> 07:53.693
So one thing you were mentioning, you said that you were feeling restless.

07:53.813 --> 07:58.080
And I was kind of curious, like, what was this restlessness from?

07:58.120 --> 08:02.588
Was it just like your personality or were there things?

08:02.829 --> 08:06.034
Because you mentioned in Sacramento, you were talking about the migrant raid.

08:06.419 --> 08:13.260
Was it political stuff like that that was making you feel restless, like you wanted to do something, or was it just something else?

08:14.002 --> 08:15.286
A combination.

08:15.567 --> 08:20.783
I didn't want to be home cleaning house.

08:21.303 --> 08:27.011
take care of my younger brother and just being domesticated because I knew there was much more to life than that.

08:27.031 --> 08:32.719
I had been at City College and I was in the Latin American group and Vietnam was going on at the time.

08:33.219 --> 08:42.332
So I knew there was much more in the world out there than just being at home and waiting for somebody to come charging them out.

08:42.886 --> 08:46.391
you know, what is it, the white horse or... Putting a ring on it?

08:47.532 --> 08:47.633
Yeah.

08:47.653 --> 08:49.655
Something along that line, you know.

08:49.675 --> 08:50.777
That wasn't my interest.

08:50.837 --> 08:54.582
I wanted to find out what the Mika Raid was about.

08:54.823 --> 08:55.243
Right.

08:55.283 --> 08:58.267
You know, and why did that happen?

08:58.287 --> 09:12.387
And just, you know, why people were content just to sit home and wait for something, you know, when...

09:12.755 --> 09:15.878
you could be doing something about something.

09:16.479 --> 09:18.040
I was aware of Vietnam.

09:19.041 --> 09:19.722
I didn't like it.

09:19.782 --> 09:20.983
My brother was in Vietnam.

09:22.665 --> 09:38.341
And I just had an eye opener as far as political awareness and not necessarily wanting to be a leader, but wanting to find out more about what the injustices were about.

09:38.421 --> 09:41.985
Yeah, I'm hearing that a lot from

09:42.455 --> 10:12.327
Some of the other people that I've interviewed is kind of the connection to the Vietnam War, that a lot of people were affected by this and that it kind of, whatever anti-war sentiments they were having is what kind of pushed them a little more towards becoming more, like wanting to participate more in Chicano movement stuff or Chicano power stuff, right?

10:12.897 --> 10:16.540
Well, yeah, and my parents were organizers themselves.

10:16.560 --> 10:25.008
They were in the community service organization here in Fresno, and that's where they met Cesar Chavez, because that's what he was doing here at the time.

10:25.689 --> 10:27.431
So they became involved in that.

10:27.471 --> 10:31.735
So as we were growing up, my brother and I, we were aware of some of this.

10:34.517 --> 10:36.159
There's another side of the story here.

10:37.020 --> 10:41.824
But the way that we grew up, we grew up in a...

10:42.462 --> 11:06.057
a real snug family environment because my parents and my relatives they all sang and and played the guitar and you know music was part of our culture and and all the sob stories that go with it you know everybody's crying and all these things you know these songs and stuff my dad wrote music you know so I knew there was more than just

11:07.184 --> 11:12.913
waiting and hanging around and what motivated my dad, what motivated my mother.

11:13.314 --> 11:19.765
So I had to go out and I had to go find out what was going on for me.

11:21.708 --> 11:32.145
So I was deeply inspired by the teatro and as far as the Vietnam War, I didn't want my brother there.

11:32.412 --> 11:33.713
I wanted him back.

11:34.034 --> 11:37.297
A couple of his friends had already died there.

11:37.317 --> 11:40.020
And it hit home a lot.

11:40.500 --> 11:53.934
And then here with all the pickets and... Like the UFW march and stuff like that?

11:53.954 --> 11:55.615
Is that what you're talking about?

11:55.996 --> 11:57.357
Well, when I went into the...

11:57.758 --> 12:03.566
Teatro, that's when I found out about the pickets and how they came about.

12:04.147 --> 12:06.791
But before that, I really didn't know about them.

12:06.811 --> 12:12.379
Like when I was involved in the Migra in 68, the Teatro was already here and the UFW was too.

12:12.960 --> 12:15.924
But I didn't hear about it over there in Sacramento.

12:18.108 --> 12:22.534
I heard about it here in Fresno, but I saw it here in Fresno.

12:23.341 --> 12:39.983
And that inspired me because I was already in the Brown Berets as well and we were doing breakfast programs and having political meetings and talking about an alternative political perspective, you know, political parties.

12:40.704 --> 12:44.789
So there was a lot of stuff going on at the same time for me, you know.

12:44.889 --> 12:51.458
But I was just a real busy bee at that time, you know.

12:51.860 --> 12:58.349
And what, um, I was going to ask you if you could say a little bit more about your participation with the Brown Berries.

12:58.469 --> 13:00.652
Like, how did you get involved with that?

13:02.034 --> 13:10.506
When I left the house, I, I was, uh, I was, I was an only, well, I was the only daughter.

13:10.526 --> 13:16.294
So there were a lot of expectations, you know, and, uh, I didn't quite meet up to them.

13:16.834 --> 13:18.437
You know, I didn't want to sit home.

13:19.899 --> 13:20.179
Uh,

13:21.593 --> 13:24.465
And I had stopped going to school for a bit.

13:24.525 --> 13:26.352
This is my daughter, okay?

13:26.373 --> 13:31.654
And so when I was out and I was...

13:32.647 --> 13:41.177
checking out the teatro, there's a friend of mine who was actually one of the berets who guided me and took me to the meetings and stuff.

13:41.297 --> 13:43.920
And I liked what I heard.

13:45.461 --> 13:46.863
I liked the logic behind it.

13:47.824 --> 13:50.968
And I was really prime with this.

13:51.388 --> 13:53.951
In every Mexican-American, there's a potential Chicano.

13:55.573 --> 14:00.418
And so I became a beret in July, July 6th, I think, of 1969.

14:00.578 --> 14:02.080
I have my brown book.

14:02.347 --> 14:18.742
And I traveled with the Burris and we had meetings here and stuff and just got more politicized, you know, alternatives to the Democratic and Republican parties.

14:19.303 --> 14:23.727
So there's more to life than just red and white and black and blue and green and yellow.

14:24.328 --> 14:25.429
Yeah.

14:25.469 --> 14:32.235
And what would you how would you describe that group or the Brown Burris when you first joined it?

14:32.873 --> 14:39.480
As opposed to, I mean, I would imagine there's maybe been some changes or, you know, throughout the years.

14:39.500 --> 14:41.522
But what was it like?

14:41.602 --> 14:44.024
What was it about during that time period?

14:44.044 --> 14:48.689
I know you mentioned that, you know, there's a Chicano and every Mexican-American.

14:49.389 --> 14:50.871
Yeah.

14:53.353 --> 14:54.194
I'll show you a picture.

14:54.214 --> 14:57.297
Yeah, sure.

14:57.317 --> 14:58.138
And I'll show it to you.

15:13.171 --> 15:24.063
These are my homies.

15:24.103 --> 15:25.325
These are my buddies.

15:25.345 --> 15:28.328
My brother's in here in Fresno.

15:28.348 --> 15:31.572
I'd get the smaller one, but I'd have to look for it.

15:31.752 --> 15:34.195
But this is all over the place now.

15:34.395 --> 15:35.376
But these are my brothers.

15:35.496 --> 15:36.777
This is the Fresno chapter.

15:38.039 --> 15:39.681
What's the first chapter?

15:40.582 --> 15:42.604
Is that here in Fresno?

15:42.955 --> 15:44.737
Oh, LA.

15:44.757 --> 15:45.758
It came from LA.

15:47.679 --> 16:00.051
And my friend Nanny, who's with the Barrios Unidos, kind of like just took over this picture.

16:01.412 --> 16:10.380
And anyway, what inspired me, what happened with the Brown Berets, these people right here,

16:11.272 --> 16:12.813
This is Catarino Hurtado.

16:12.874 --> 16:18.159
He was the main person that got everybody together.

16:18.179 --> 16:24.344
And this is the person that got me into the berets.

16:25.285 --> 16:32.152
And my mentor, besides Cat and Pat, is not in here.

16:34.394 --> 16:40.840
But we talked philosophy, we read books, you know, and we talked about

16:41.056 --> 16:43.801
injustices here in Fresno.

16:43.841 --> 16:52.617
We talked about what we could do to help out, you know, the poor people, you know, we started breakfast programs here at the school.

16:52.838 --> 16:56.685
And we were here

16:57.526 --> 17:02.713
The motto for the Brown Berets is to serve, observe, and protect.

17:02.973 --> 17:04.756
And I believe that wholeheartedly.

17:04.776 --> 17:08.361
And also that once you're a beret, you're always a beret.

17:08.381 --> 17:16.632
So the difference between these people here and what inspired me with these people, these guys here, there were women too, okay?

17:16.652 --> 17:19.456
There were about six of us, but you don't see us here.

17:20.898 --> 17:24.563
And I got there right when they were getting up.

17:24.830 --> 17:27.492
So I missed out on this, but yeah.

17:28.093 --> 17:37.441
But anyway, the difference between these people here is that they protected their families, but their families didn't really get involved with them.

17:37.481 --> 17:39.242
They stayed home.

17:39.262 --> 17:52.553
The Brown Berets here in Fresno, from what I can see, their families are involved, but it's not quite as aggressive as my brother's here, okay?

17:53.574 --> 17:54.415
And...

17:56.234 --> 18:14.374
When I was in the berets, if they wanted to go dance, if there was a shindig going on or something that we were at, they would say, here, Lupita, hold this for me.

18:14.955 --> 18:20.260
So there they are, and they're giving me their cuetes, and I'm putting them in my bag so they can go dance.

18:21.602 --> 18:22.443
That's how they saw me.

18:22.543 --> 18:25.326
I was a sister.

18:25.346 --> 18:26.207
Thank you.

18:26.862 --> 18:32.087
But I don't know how many other people know the names of these guys here.

18:32.127 --> 18:34.289
I've never heard anybody made mention of them.

18:35.129 --> 18:42.215
But I know pretty much all of their placasos, like this one right here, is cornets.

18:42.235 --> 18:54.226
Chicago, Patricio, Joe, Joselito, Cat, Bobby Reyes, Joe, Joe, Mongolian.

18:54.506 --> 18:56.548
You know, he had like four or five Joes.

18:56.849 --> 18:59.934
But they were all different.

19:00.895 --> 19:06.605
And he's died of AIDS in prison because a lot of them were junkies.

19:06.625 --> 19:11.693
And that was a big difference between our group here that don't really talk about.

19:12.734 --> 19:20.827
But if you met us then and you knew us, you knew that some of these guys were a little bit weird, you know.

19:20.847 --> 19:23.211
But everybody and...

19:23.697 --> 19:32.368
focused on familia and what we could bring to the community as far as services.

19:32.388 --> 19:35.572
And that's why the breakfast program to us was a really good thing.

19:35.612 --> 19:42.781
It got the city inspired to continue with it at a later point.

19:44.804 --> 19:46.246
Because there was nothing at the time.

19:46.646 --> 19:48.709
Right.

19:49.347 --> 19:58.216
In many ways, kind of the program or the mission that you're talking about here reminds me of like the Black Panthers in Oakland, right?

19:58.236 --> 19:58.336
Yeah.

19:58.356 --> 20:05.784
And so would you say that they were very much influenced by the Black Panther program?

20:06.365 --> 20:11.090
Or would you say maybe it's kind of its own organic scene?

20:11.891 --> 20:13.212
Along the parallel lines.

20:13.748 --> 20:18.254
Yes, you know, there's a lot of similarities, you know.

20:19.255 --> 20:26.145
But to me, the Black Panthers, they were more aggressive.

20:26.165 --> 20:39.122
And, you know, these guys, I saw them as protectors, you know.

20:39.563 --> 20:42.827
And they would, if they had to, you know,

20:43.077 --> 20:45.720
stand up, you know, for your rights.

20:46.501 --> 20:52.448
But they wouldn't start riots or start beating up people and stuff like that.

20:53.128 --> 20:58.895
They weren't those type of men, you know.

20:59.576 --> 21:03.320
And you saw, like, the Black Panthers as more aware?

21:03.340 --> 21:06.784
Yeah, they were a little bit more aggressive, more reactionary.

21:06.804 --> 21:09.207
And we were reactionary, but we thought about it.

21:09.267 --> 21:11.329
We saw it from a different light.

21:11.832 --> 21:14.795
and then which road should we take.

21:15.596 --> 21:20.561
And a lot of that had to do with Cat, okay, because he was the one that was the stabilizer.

21:21.622 --> 21:26.166
And he was the one that would say all the time, in every Mexican-American, there's a potential Chicano.

21:27.047 --> 21:29.049
That was him.

21:29.409 --> 21:39.139
And so he did a lot for the group, and everybody admired him, and we were known in L.A., you know, well, we were known all over the place, you know.

21:39.457 --> 21:42.961
because we're a particular group and very unique.

21:44.663 --> 21:46.024
And there were a lot of fun.

21:46.044 --> 21:52.392
So in between the Teatro Campesino, I was going to the Brown Beret meetings, you know, back and forth.

21:52.592 --> 21:59.940
And then you have said that you were part of the Fresno State Alumni Association, right?

22:00.341 --> 22:01.682
The Chicano Alumni Association.

22:01.762 --> 22:03.024
Chicano Alumni Association.

22:03.464 --> 22:06.848
So during that time period that you're...

22:07.553 --> 22:16.407
In 69, when you're getting involved with the Brown Berets and with Teatro Campesino, are you already a student at Fresno State or not yet?

22:17.068 --> 22:21.896
In 1969, I went to Fresno State.

22:21.916 --> 22:22.897
I was in the teatro.

22:23.017 --> 22:24.480
Luis Valdez was teaching there.

22:25.461 --> 22:31.311
And Elisa Risco and several other activists, okay?

22:32.172 --> 22:34.776
And I had a health...

22:35.077 --> 23:00.055
issue that made me drop out and so I didn't go back for about 20 years but my brother had just come back from Vietnam right around that time and he was going to City College and you know getting his education started there and then he went to Fresno State and he and another

23:00.541 --> 23:23.494
Vietnam vet I guess we're talking and they saw I think it happened in Santa Barbara I'm not quite sure Chicano commencement that they had done over there and they wanted to bring it to Fresno so they wrote a thesis my brother wrote a thesis on and brought the Chicano commencement to Fresno State and this year they celebrated 43 years it's the largest

23:24.942 --> 23:30.510
I know it was probably the oldest and the largest in the United States, you know.

23:30.530 --> 23:41.948
And so from the beginnings where I think there were like 56 graduates in the beginning in 1977, they had like 11, 1200 this year, you know.

23:41.968 --> 23:42.629
Interesting.

23:42.649 --> 23:44.892
Yeah, but that was all

23:46.846 --> 23:56.784
from him, but I was still out here and I would join him, you know, during the ceremony because I liked it.

23:56.824 --> 23:58.267
I thought it was pretty cool.

23:58.287 --> 24:01.433
The graduate would sit there and say, you know, five minutes worth of something.

24:01.473 --> 24:03.016
You could at the time because it was small.

24:03.858 --> 24:07.304
And to the family and the children running up and down and all that stuff, you know.

24:08.145 --> 24:10.069
And so that...

24:11.247 --> 24:14.792
I got where he was coming from.

24:15.614 --> 24:22.785
And so I just always supported it and every year I'd go out whenever I could and be there to help him.

24:22.805 --> 24:31.939
So that was always part of my being because it was him.

24:32.510 --> 24:33.593
Yeah.

24:33.813 --> 24:50.653
So, okay, the picture I'm getting, just tell me if I'm correct or not, but it sounds like, so you're from Fresno, you're in Fresno during this time period, 1969, and just by virtue, because it's not necessarily that you're

24:51.055 --> 25:11.950
you're encountering Brown Berets or Teatro Campesino as a student at Fresno State but you're just you're part of the community here and they're part of the community here and so you're kind of getting involved that way you end up going to or finishing at Fresno State right

25:12.284 --> 25:41.177
um okay so that's kind of yeah i was a community worker you got that right okay and i went in this community and when i was working with the chicano commencement i was the community uh contact okay okay cool um oh the other thing i was going to ask you you had you had mentioned the church that teatro campesino was performing at and i was just curious if it was saint alphonse or saint alphonse no it was a church that was uh

25:42.288 --> 25:46.272
I don't know if it was abandoned or anything or they had left it and relocated.

25:46.832 --> 25:52.517
So the Teatro Campesino used it as their center, their cultural center.

25:52.538 --> 25:55.680
So it was just like some kind of like, kind of dust water?

25:56.521 --> 25:56.621
Yeah.

25:56.641 --> 25:59.584
Like, oh, here's a building with four walls.

26:00.425 --> 26:06.130
No, I guess they rented it, you know, but anyway, it had everything that you could ask.

26:06.190 --> 26:10.354
It had offices, it had a stage and, you know,

26:10.486 --> 26:19.296
you could sit down and watch the theater perform and you could practice there, you know, and, uh, it was just really convenient.

26:19.476 --> 26:24.923
And, uh, and we got paid $5 of performance.

26:24.943 --> 26:26.084
Nice.

26:26.104 --> 26:28.867
All right.

26:29.528 --> 26:34.013
So, um, I kind of want to go back a little bit to your,

26:34.212 --> 26:35.936
what you were talking about with your parents.

26:36.077 --> 26:39.786
So you said that your parents had been involved in the CSO, right?

26:40.849 --> 26:46.804
And so did you feel like that was...

26:48.539 --> 27:02.774
like kind of growing up with parents who were somewhat politically aware or conscious, that that translated to your kind of, you know, you were talking about being restless.

27:03.915 --> 27:05.536
And you're how old during this time?

27:05.556 --> 27:07.378
Like in your maybe early 20s?

27:07.518 --> 27:10.221
Oh, I'm in my early 20s, yeah.

27:10.281 --> 27:12.523
When they were in the CSO, I was younger, I was in high school.

27:13.144 --> 27:14.025
But I didn't know.

27:14.806 --> 27:17.989
I didn't realize that that was what they were doing.

27:17.969 --> 27:20.352
And it was just a way of life for us.

27:20.373 --> 27:20.713
Right.

27:20.793 --> 27:21.134
You know?

27:21.915 --> 27:23.818
And I never heard of Caesar.

27:23.858 --> 27:24.839
I didn't know who he was.

27:24.859 --> 27:26.441
I didn't hear about Caesar until later.

27:26.461 --> 27:32.630
And my mom and dad said, oh, yeah, he was, we met him when he was over here and he was working with us organizing.

27:33.071 --> 27:34.012
I said, oh, okay.

27:35.995 --> 27:37.738
You know, that guy, you know, okay.

27:37.758 --> 27:41.103
And your parents, were they involved with the CSO and that?

27:41.263 --> 27:44.668
Because they were farm workers themselves or?

27:44.918 --> 27:54.033
Well, they grew up, you know, in the campesino world.

27:54.213 --> 27:59.662
But my dad had a heart condition, so he couldn't stay out there working.

27:59.722 --> 28:02.106
So he had to find an office job or something.

28:02.647 --> 28:06.854
So he ended up working with the city of Fresno for like 29 and a half years.

28:07.395 --> 28:11.702
And my mother, she was always...

28:12.847 --> 28:32.977
bettering herself and went to, got a high school diploma, just found ways to, you know, do things better for her family because they were poor when they were younger and nobody had any money.

28:33.097 --> 28:38.385
So, in fact, my folks were the rich people in the family, you know, on both sides.

28:39.307 --> 28:41.470
But...

28:43.407 --> 29:02.698
I just remember as a youngster that my dad always seemed to be searching for a better way, a better life, for the family to be up to a better status,

29:03.252 --> 29:04.473
I don't know what the hell he was looking for.

29:05.094 --> 29:10.080
And my mother, too, you know, and the people that they met and stuff like that.

29:10.821 --> 29:21.093
And working with the CSO and then going, working in the church, you know, doing religious stuff.

29:21.134 --> 29:22.655
They were always doing something.

29:22.996 --> 29:25.459
And that's the way that we grew up, always doing something.

29:26.200 --> 29:28.683
Like involved it with the community in some way.

29:29.544 --> 29:29.764
Me.

29:29.824 --> 29:29.884
Me.

29:30.033 --> 29:37.456
Me, but them, yes, with the community, the church, the family parties.

29:37.757 --> 29:39.823
They were the leaders, you know?

29:40.276 --> 29:42.318
In our family, they were the leaders.

29:42.799 --> 29:45.302
Like the organizers, like, hey, we're doing this.

29:45.322 --> 29:48.906
And that's all that we knew.

29:49.727 --> 29:51.569
My younger brother, he grew up that way.

29:51.609 --> 29:52.831
I'm 13 years older than him.

29:53.371 --> 29:54.532
And so that's all that he knew.

29:54.693 --> 29:56.995
We went from meeting to meeting to meeting with my folks.

29:57.756 --> 30:04.164
That reminds me of when I was a kid, my mom used to have this picture of Che Guevara.

30:05.125 --> 30:07.988
And I always thought for the longest time, like, oh, that's my uncle.

30:10.516 --> 30:13.339
But yeah, so I totally understand that.

30:13.439 --> 30:39.865
But your parents, so were they, like how long has your family been in California or were they, like my grandparents, my grandparents are I think first generation because their parents were in Mexico during the revolution and came over to the United States kind of like

30:40.790 --> 30:49.124
maybe like in the 20s, in the early 20s, they came over to the United States and then both of my grandparents were born here.

30:51.148 --> 31:05.532
But were your parents, had your family been here in California for a long time or were they kind of also recent or first generation from Mexico?

31:05.832 --> 31:08.895
My grandparents on my mom's side are from Sinaloa.

31:09.415 --> 31:12.318
On my dad's side, they're from Chihuahua.

31:12.338 --> 31:21.827
And both my mom and dad grew up in Somerton, Arizona, which is like 12, 13 miles from Yuma, Arizona.

31:22.608 --> 31:28.814
And of course, right down the street from Somerton is San Luis, Rio Colorado in Mexico.

31:29.495 --> 31:34.219
So we grew up, you know, knowing about the border and

31:34.503 --> 31:56.175
the border patrol over there and all the campesinos and the, I mean, we'd go visit them and you'd see the, the indios over there in their, uh, uh, wagons, you know, going down the middle of the street, you know, and so there was a lot of, a lot of mixture of people.

31:56.555 --> 32:01.202
But, uh, when my parents, uh,

32:02.448 --> 32:24.942
got married, they went to L.A., and that's why I was born in L.A., and that was during the Pachuco time, and my mother didn't want my dad to be involved in the Pachuco, so back to Yuma, and my brother was born in Yuma, and then my uncle, because he and my dad were in the military together, and he came... World War II?

32:24.962 --> 32:25.523
Yeah, okay.

32:25.543 --> 32:27.426
But he was a carpenter,

32:28.435 --> 32:36.286
cabinet maker and he came to Fresno and he told my dad come over here because they were living in projects.

32:36.306 --> 32:42.134
So my mom and dad came over but we didn't quite live in the projects right away.

32:42.154 --> 32:52.468
We lived on the west side in a little garage and eventually we got into the projects and then from there my dad started going up, up and up and my mother

32:52.820 --> 33:00.270
you know, better, better, and better for us because they didn't want for us to be poor like they had grown up.

33:00.571 --> 33:03.635
So yeah, they were born in the United States.

33:03.795 --> 33:06.899
My grandparents were born in Mexico.

33:07.380 --> 33:17.033
And oddly enough, my grandfather on my mom's side, my great-grandmother was Mayo, India, and he always denied that.

33:17.194 --> 33:18.996
You know, he denied the indigenous

33:19.297 --> 33:21.721
But that was pretty common in him.

33:21.781 --> 33:27.009
So I'm Yakimaio because of my culture.

33:27.250 --> 33:34.762
Yeah, so that's a good, maybe a good point for us to switch into the other conversation about mestizaje.

33:35.943 --> 33:44.717
But before I do that, is there anything else you want to talk about in terms of your participation with the Chicano movement?

33:44.978 --> 33:45.118
Yeah.

33:46.381 --> 33:48.043
that we haven't covered already?

33:48.063 --> 33:52.988
I mean, we talked about Teatro Campesino, Brown Berets.

33:55.751 --> 33:56.772
I don't know if there's anything else.

33:57.633 --> 34:03.780
Well, yeah, that was a really strong point in my life.

34:03.840 --> 34:06.383
I was really happy doing all of that.

34:06.403 --> 34:13.350
And there were some negative things that came afterwards, you know, but

34:14.410 --> 34:16.192
That was just part of life and moving on.

34:16.232 --> 34:18.435
And I eventually went back to Fresno State.

34:18.455 --> 34:19.856
It took me 20 years.

34:19.876 --> 34:21.858
But I got back in, got a B.A.

34:24.541 --> 34:25.783
in liberal studies.

34:26.824 --> 34:29.267
And then I ended up going through the social work program.

34:30.308 --> 34:36.835
So I was a child protective services social worker for 16 years.

34:37.276 --> 34:37.656
Oh, wow.

34:37.877 --> 34:39.939
Based on what I learned out on the streets.

34:40.299 --> 34:41.701
Yeah, that's great.

34:42.562 --> 34:42.662
Yeah.

34:43.418 --> 34:49.605
Actually, I was going to ask you, at Fresno State, do they have like a Chicano Studies or something like that?

34:49.625 --> 34:50.065
Yeah, they do.

34:50.366 --> 34:52.688
Yeah, they do.

34:52.868 --> 34:54.330
But it wasn't there when I was there.

34:54.770 --> 34:55.051
Right.

34:55.131 --> 34:56.432
I missed all of that.

34:56.652 --> 34:58.835
That came after the fact.

34:58.855 --> 35:00.497
Do you know when that program started?

35:00.517 --> 35:04.681
Well, when I went back to Fresno State, I went in the mid-80s.

35:04.701 --> 35:06.683
I graduated in 89 with my VA.

35:07.084 --> 35:07.384
Mm-hmm.

35:09.929 --> 35:22.383
So I was there in like about 86 and they were already there, but I didn't participate in any of that because my focus, and they even had a re-entry program for, you know, olders.

35:24.345 --> 35:25.687
But I didn't do any of that.

35:25.707 --> 35:31.953
The only thing that I participated in and my only focus was the Chicano commencement.

35:32.094 --> 35:33.075
That was it.

35:33.095 --> 35:38.721
So how did you get involved with the Chicano Alumni Association?

35:39.427 --> 35:42.552
Chicano commencement is the umbrella from the Chicano alumni.

35:43.173 --> 35:44.776
Okay, I gotcha.

35:44.796 --> 35:47.781
And I'm still working with the Chicano alumni.

35:47.882 --> 35:51.007
It's changed from association to Chicano alumni club.

35:51.027 --> 35:52.870
And we're the ones that are going to have that banquet.

35:52.890 --> 35:53.712
Yeah.

35:53.732 --> 36:01.305
So I was going to say that a couple of weeks ago, I did an interview with Lupa and Luis Valdez.

36:01.525 --> 36:01.866
Oh, yeah.

36:02.527 --> 36:04.911
And they were talking about how...

36:05.566 --> 36:13.918
You know, Luis's first classes are the classes that he was teaching there when like kind of mid to late 60s.

36:13.998 --> 36:15.581
Right.

36:15.601 --> 36:16.522
1969.

36:17.764 --> 36:18.084
Yeah.

36:18.104 --> 36:22.811
Well, I think he said that it was or maybe it was Lupe who mentioned it.

36:23.112 --> 36:26.457
But yeah, it may have been like a couple of years earlier.

36:26.597 --> 36:26.697
Yeah.

36:26.947 --> 36:27.748
Yeah.

36:27.768 --> 36:35.699
That they had, that he was teaching classes under this label of raza studies, right?

36:36.240 --> 36:46.294
And so I was just wondering if maybe there was a connection between what he was doing with the raza studies to then what ended up becoming Chicano studies there.

36:46.334 --> 36:55.046
But it sounds like there was a really big gap between what he was doing there and then what may have become a Chicano studies department.

36:55.166 --> 36:55.266
Yeah.

36:55.432 --> 36:56.914
Yeah, it was more that.

36:57.214 --> 37:01.760
They initiated it.

37:02.121 --> 37:03.182
Valdez.

37:03.202 --> 37:05.445
Yeah, and Eliezer Risco.

37:06.266 --> 37:06.767
What is that?

37:06.907 --> 37:07.628
Eliezer?

37:07.828 --> 37:08.749
Eliezer Risco.

37:08.769 --> 37:10.652
He passed away.

37:10.672 --> 37:14.216
E-L-I-Z-E-R.

37:17.641 --> 37:19.042
Z-E-R.

37:19.183 --> 37:19.583
Eliezer.

37:21.740 --> 37:22.361
I forgot.

37:22.461 --> 37:24.024
Ellie said S-E-R?

37:24.665 --> 37:26.067
Z-E-R?

37:26.087 --> 37:27.149
Risco's his last name.

37:27.670 --> 37:28.351
R-I-S-E-O.

37:28.772 --> 37:31.537
R-I-S... He's a Cubano.

37:31.557 --> 37:32.278
Oh, Risco?

37:32.538 --> 37:32.939
Uh-huh.

37:33.600 --> 37:33.700
Okay.

37:33.760 --> 37:34.001
Yeah.

37:34.121 --> 37:36.165
Maybe I can look him up on Google or something.

37:36.185 --> 37:37.827
Yeah, yeah, he lived here.

37:38.148 --> 37:40.352
Or I could ask probably Luis would know.

37:41.053 --> 37:41.654
Yeah.

37:41.674 --> 37:42.175
Mm-hmm.

37:42.195 --> 37:43.357
Yeah.

37:43.377 --> 37:44.659
I actually have...

37:45.247 --> 37:51.898
the show that they had over there at Fresno State in 1969 while he was teaching there.

37:52.499 --> 37:57.186
And some of those students became some of the workers for the Teatro Campesino.

37:59.310 --> 38:05.179
Your dad was one of them, you know, that came over from that student group.

38:05.665 --> 38:06.025
Yeah.

38:06.806 --> 38:08.668
I was, I should ask you that.

38:08.688 --> 38:12.032
How did you meet my dad that was here at Fresno, right?

38:12.092 --> 38:15.977
Yeah, that was when Luis was teaching over there at Fresno State.

38:16.738 --> 38:28.110
And your dad was one of the students that came over to Actos and, you know, work with Luis because he liked him.

38:28.130 --> 38:28.331
Yeah.

38:28.371 --> 38:31.234
You know, him and Manuel Pickett and...

38:31.720 --> 38:32.802
several other people.

38:34.604 --> 38:36.127
So that's where I got to meet those guys.

38:40.233 --> 38:40.834
That was fun.

38:43.097 --> 38:43.417
All right.

38:44.980 --> 38:47.584
Let me see if there's anything else I want to add.

38:47.604 --> 38:48.064
One other thing.

38:48.124 --> 38:48.285
Sure.

38:50.268 --> 38:58.240
That I really enjoyed while I was in the theater is, you know, the epic poem, I am Joaquin by Corky Gonzalez.

38:58.360 --> 38:59.922
I was

39:00.340 --> 39:14.353
in the teatro when they were practicing in the music and Luis was telling the story, you know, the poem as we know it now, you know.

39:14.373 --> 39:20.579
And one of my, well, my co-worker, Teresa, played the recorder.

39:21.480 --> 39:26.905
Teresa's one of the ones that helps me out with these...

39:27.998 --> 39:57.398
pots and saucers now she's one of my neighbors so I've known her for 50 years oh wow you're still around how nice and then you guys live like right next to each other yeah but she did the recorder and that was really really awe inspiring I had never heard the poem and I was just amazed by it and the way it came down so when we saw it afterwards you know as you know like with the first showing and all that and the response from all the people

39:58.323 --> 40:03.831
Boy, that was a proud time, you know.

40:04.512 --> 40:04.672
Wow.

40:06.414 --> 40:07.656
That's great.

40:07.916 --> 40:14.165
Okay, so that's another good kind of segue to that next question about mestizaje.

40:14.385 --> 40:21.074
So you're familiar with the term mestizaje or mestizo identity?

40:21.475 --> 40:22.276
Mestizo, yes.

40:22.316 --> 40:23.898
Mestizaje, I know.

40:23.918 --> 40:24.699
Mestizaje?

40:24.799 --> 40:28.144
It's kind of like Chicano X and Chicana X type stuff now.

40:28.327 --> 40:29.848
They keep changing.

40:29.868 --> 40:31.470
Yeah, that is true.

40:31.610 --> 40:40.918
Mestizaje is more like, it'd be kind of like, you know, when you use the term Chicano to refer like, oh, I'm a Chicano, right?

40:41.379 --> 40:49.426
But when you say Chicanismo, that means something more like kind of like the idea of what it is to be a Chicano, right?

40:49.486 --> 40:51.768
So mestizaje is kind of like that.

40:51.788 --> 40:56.933
So you would say maybe like mestizo would refer to the identity of

40:57.233 --> 41:03.542
And then mestizaje would be like the whole concept of what that means and all that.

41:03.562 --> 41:04.343
Does that make sense?

41:06.407 --> 41:06.787
Kind of.

41:07.408 --> 41:10.953
So, I mean, it's basically like, it's basically the same.

41:11.254 --> 41:14.278
It means the same thing, mestizaje, mestizo.

41:15.700 --> 41:20.127
It's just kind of like another way of saying it.

41:21.268 --> 41:25.755
So, but you're familiar with what it means to be mestizo.

41:25.955 --> 41:27.457
or what that means.

41:27.477 --> 41:44.201
Yeah, I think the one that says it from my perspective, the one who's said it in an eloquent way is Daniel Valdez with his Mestizo in America de los Indios.

41:47.665 --> 41:55.877
He tells the story and of course he's very... This is a song

41:56.228 --> 41:57.590
you're talking about?

41:57.610 --> 42:14.469
Uh, yeah, he, he, uh, yeah, America de los Injos is a song, but, uh, it's the story of a mestizo, you know, and, uh, I recently got it and I saved it on my phone.

42:14.489 --> 42:15.170
I could show it to you.

42:15.410 --> 42:16.532
Yeah, that would be great.

42:16.572 --> 42:17.713
And, uh,

42:17.913 --> 42:21.379
Maybe I could forward it to you or something so you can listen to it.

42:21.459 --> 42:22.040
Sure.

42:22.061 --> 42:23.824
But it's really great.

42:23.844 --> 42:39.432
And he talks about all the clashings and the, you know, identity, the loss of identity, the need for identity.

42:39.918 --> 42:41.540
the resurgence of identity.

42:42.481 --> 42:45.004
It's kind of like what's happening with the natives right now.

42:46.346 --> 42:52.573
I'm reading a book right now called There, There, and it's about an Oakland powwow.

42:52.873 --> 43:02.044
And these youngsters, they're young adults, teenagers and stuff, they're wanting to know more about their Indian culture.

43:02.446 --> 43:05.390
you know, more of their history, oral history.

43:05.450 --> 43:06.232
Nobody's telling them.

43:06.652 --> 43:06.873
Right.

43:07.013 --> 43:08.595
You know, nobody wants to talk about it.

43:09.196 --> 43:18.770
So they use the word urban natives, which to me, I could relate to that.

43:19.231 --> 43:19.511
Yeah.

43:19.532 --> 43:31.930
You know, when I think some of it, too, is not just that they don't want to talk about it, but a lot of people just don't know because that's part of kind of like the oppression, right, is

43:33.040 --> 43:39.290
taking, taking kids away from their families so that they don't know these things and there's a disconnect, right?

43:39.310 --> 43:41.274
And that's what the story entails.

43:41.294 --> 43:41.694
Yeah.

43:42.135 --> 43:46.963
So that's, that's really interesting because you are, you're right.

43:46.983 --> 43:59.824
You're starting to see this kind of like resurgence of, um, you know, people want to know who they're, who they are and what they're about and, you know, and are recognizing

44:00.226 --> 44:14.698
hey, there's this kind of, like, gap between, you know, what my parents know and don't know and what my ancestors, their parents or their grandparents knew, and now I don't have access to them because they're gone, right?

44:15.779 --> 44:18.541
And all the política behind that.

44:18.562 --> 44:19.042
Yeah.

44:19.062 --> 44:19.843
It's really amazing.

44:20.063 --> 44:21.124
Yeah, exactly.

44:21.204 --> 44:21.944
Another story.

44:22.385 --> 44:23.366
Yeah.

44:24.627 --> 44:28.850
So this song that you were just talking about by Danny.

44:29.050 --> 44:29.811
Daniel Lopez, yeah.

44:30.280 --> 44:32.604
You're talking, you're talking about Luis's brother, right?

44:32.624 --> 44:32.864
Yeah.

44:33.966 --> 44:42.399
Um, that, that he kind of talks about the story of the mestizo in that song, right?

44:42.419 --> 44:42.940
Yeah.

44:43.400 --> 44:50.211
And, um, but just before you were talking about Corky's Yo Soy Joaquin, right?

44:50.231 --> 44:51.693
I am Joaquin, yeah.

44:51.713 --> 44:54.938
And would you say they're kind of like similar or is there like

44:55.357 --> 45:02.269
a real kind of big difference between what Corky is talking about and then what Danny is talking about in this song?

45:03.511 --> 45:05.774
There are similarities, yes.

45:15.250 --> 45:21.060
Danny is... he...

45:22.087 --> 45:33.481
he's more comfortable saying it through music and Corky was more comfortable saying it through words and poetry.

45:35.764 --> 45:47.318
But along the same line, the losses, the suffering, the resurgence, the pride, all of that,

45:48.293 --> 45:52.258
Corky wrote it one way and Danny sings it another way.

45:52.838 --> 45:55.381
But there's a lot of similarities.

45:58.786 --> 46:15.145
Would you say that you're, like, were you introduced to this idea of mestizo because of your participation, like hearing that poem through Luis?

46:15.682 --> 46:18.826
or hearing this song through Danny's music?

46:19.327 --> 46:25.435
Or is it something that you were aware of before interacting with these different groups?

46:28.959 --> 46:32.824
Well, in my own family, we didn't talk about indigenousness, okay?

46:34.487 --> 46:35.448
Nobody was Native.

46:36.629 --> 46:38.191
You didn't want to be Native.

46:38.271 --> 46:41.676
What did they, do you remember, like, how did they refer to themselves?

46:41.856 --> 46:42.717
Well, they didn't talk about them.

46:43.919 --> 46:45.621
My grandfather didn't talk about his mother.

46:45.905 --> 46:50.693
I never met her and if I did, I don't remember her.

46:51.073 --> 46:59.828
My mother didn't talk about her, but she did a little bit when she would show us how she and my uncle did the matachines, the dents.

47:00.869 --> 47:10.545
So there was something there, but it was something that was repressed because that wasn't what the family wanted to hear because

47:10.998 --> 47:19.288
they were of lesser being, you know, and my grandfather didn't see himself that way, you know.

47:19.308 --> 47:25.256
This was your, you're talking about your, but you're talking about your, your great grandmother who was Mayan?

47:25.276 --> 47:26.277
She was Mayo.

47:26.637 --> 47:27.238
Oh, Mayo.

47:27.258 --> 47:27.779
Mayo, yeah.

47:27.799 --> 47:29.201
They're the cousins to the Yaqui.

47:29.421 --> 47:29.741
Okay.

47:29.901 --> 47:30.823
They're from Sinaloa.

47:31.243 --> 47:32.725
Oh, okay.

47:32.745 --> 47:33.586
Yeah, not the Mayo.

47:33.786 --> 47:35.308
Yeah, yeah, yeah, Mayo.

47:35.328 --> 47:35.889
Mayo, yeah.

47:36.770 --> 47:38.372
And, and,

47:38.875 --> 47:44.680
In trying to pursue my own history, I've learned a lot about him, of course, learned more than I ever knew.

47:45.641 --> 48:08.882
And only through my insistence that, you know, this is part of my history, part of my culture, and part of my being, you know, that's why I pursued it, you know, because there was more to me than what my parents had,

48:09.605 --> 48:11.126
proposed, I suppose.

48:11.727 --> 48:14.169
And that was always a curiosity to me.

48:14.730 --> 48:28.123
I remember when I was 12, my mother sent me to the store inside while they waited in the car and told me to get a gift for a , one of the daughters or something like that was having a party.

48:28.583 --> 48:31.626
So I did, and it was a copper bracelet, very indigenous looking.

48:33.168 --> 48:37.072
And I got it, and my mother saw it, and she said, oh, how embarrassing.

48:37.132 --> 48:38.633
They're going to think that they're Indian.

48:40.334 --> 48:42.618
And I'm looking at its beauty.

48:44.141 --> 48:46.385
Totally different planes.

48:46.665 --> 48:52.095
But that was the first time I heard that, and it stayed on my mind.

48:52.636 --> 48:55.501
There's something wrong here.

48:55.521 --> 48:56.403
Interesting.

48:57.084 --> 48:57.665
I was 12.

48:59.929 --> 49:04.738
So it took a while to catch up, but I'm here.

49:05.579 --> 49:33.472
So this was something, well, okay, so it sounds like what you're saying is that prior to any of your involvement with Chicano movement groups or organizations, that you had an awareness that there is some sort of indigenous element to who you were, but that it was repressed by your own family.

49:33.893 --> 49:34.033
Mm-hmm.

49:34.807 --> 49:39.997
And do you know, like, why they did that?

49:40.338 --> 49:42.182
Or did you have any idea?

49:42.342 --> 49:44.907
Or you just... At the time, I didn't know why.

49:45.528 --> 49:52.402
At the time, I didn't know why they were acting that way or why they would not want to speak about their relatives openly.

49:52.743 --> 49:52.883
Mm-hmm.

49:52.863 --> 50:22.093
And only in researching and doing readings did it become more clear that it was more like a survival tactic with their relatives, with their families, because in Mexico, you know, they didn't like the Indians and the Spaniards didn't like the Indians, you know, and so they were always being killed or enslaved or

50:22.428 --> 50:47.878
you know exploited yeah exploited belittled you know they were always the lesser being and so part of that was survival on that part you know the yaki and the mayo and all the other indios and uh and then it became more of a political thing with the families i think in my own family and and uh

50:49.192 --> 50:58.424
And an embarrassment in a sense, you know, because on my mother's side, you have a whole slew of colors.

50:58.444 --> 51:05.092
You have green eyes, you have gray eyes, blue eyes, hazel, a lot of Spaniard.

51:06.134 --> 51:08.156
And on my dad's side, well, here I am.

51:09.258 --> 51:16.627
You know, you have a lot of native, you know, I look very, very brown.

51:16.907 --> 51:17.528
And...

51:18.200 --> 51:25.890
And so my grandfather, my mother's dad, didn't care for me too much.

51:26.932 --> 51:32.118
Or my brother because we were too Indian looking.

51:34.462 --> 51:40.890
And they accepted my brothers more than they did me because they were taller.

51:41.291 --> 51:46.097
My brother has green eyes, hazel eyes, and they spoke more eloquently and all these other

51:46.938 --> 51:50.922
a rationale as to why they would be more acceptable, but not me.

51:50.942 --> 51:55.667
And so it became kind of like, I want to know why.

51:55.687 --> 51:59.271
So that's why I got more interested and more involved.

51:59.331 --> 52:16.590
And I wanted to find out more about my own family, you know, and so that my brother started me out with that because my youngest brother, because he's married to Chukchuan Si Table Mountain.

52:16.807 --> 52:20.392
tribal member?

52:22.496 --> 52:28.645
No, she's one of those that is having issues with the tribal enrollment, stuff like that.

52:28.665 --> 52:31.409
And that goes back to a lot of politica and stuff.

52:31.589 --> 52:35.235
So she's a descendant of them, but is having issues with that.

52:35.255 --> 52:41.965
And she's got her enrollment numbers and stuff, but the acceptance by the tribes and all that politica that they're involved in.

52:42.546 --> 52:46.071
But that kind of opened my eyes about, well,

52:46.456 --> 52:47.257
What about me?

52:47.398 --> 52:49.240
And I'm hearing my brother talk.

52:49.260 --> 52:50.502
So I went beyond my brother.

52:51.384 --> 52:53.948
And I, you know, learned more about it.

52:54.028 --> 52:56.752
And I actually made a family tree.

52:56.993 --> 53:00.579
You know, go back like seven, nine generations.

53:00.719 --> 53:01.380
Then I'm stuck.

53:04.264 --> 53:06.788
Yeah.

53:08.691 --> 53:13.459
So it sounds like you... Maybe you didn't...

53:16.493 --> 53:27.806
Maybe you didn't, like, talk or use those exact terms of mestizo or mestizaje, but it's something that's around or you're aware of.

53:29.067 --> 53:38.738
There's an indigenous aspect to who we are as Mexicans, right, or Mexican, Mexicano or Chicano.

53:39.022 --> 53:39.603
Yeah.

53:39.623 --> 53:40.524
Being in the US.

53:42.226 --> 53:43.347
Did you ever think of it?

53:43.407 --> 53:51.516
Like, I know that Corky, when he talks about it, he talks about it in terms of we're both colonized or uncolonized, right?

53:51.536 --> 53:56.182
We're Spanish and we're indigenous, right?

53:56.202 --> 53:58.064
That that's what the mestizo is.

53:58.745 --> 53:59.405
Yeah.

53:59.425 --> 54:04.371
None of this came about for me until I actually

54:05.701 --> 54:07.564
became part of the Teatro Campesino.

54:07.664 --> 54:10.648
They're the ones that opened all of that.

54:11.309 --> 54:13.192
They opened the door for me.

54:14.734 --> 54:28.034
If there was something in the past as I was growing up, it was always at the back of my head that there was something beyond what my parents and grandparents were saying or thinking or feeling.

54:28.735 --> 54:32.400
But it wasn't until I got into the Teatro Campesino

54:32.600 --> 54:38.228
And the Brown Berets that we spoke about openly.

54:38.248 --> 54:40.431
And that's when the doors opened for me.

54:41.172 --> 54:47.380
Because then I knew about what a mestizo was.

54:47.901 --> 54:49.664
I learned about indigenous culture.

54:50.305 --> 54:57.054
I learned about the colonialism, you know, more so than what I had learned in school.

54:58.256 --> 55:00.058
And so that became a...

55:00.393 --> 55:03.556
the greatest avenue for me.

55:03.576 --> 55:03.776
Right.

55:04.577 --> 55:28.719
So you would say that a lot of, or would you say that a lot of your kind of education about Chicanismo, mestizo identity, the history, all of that, really kind of began a lot more with your participation with Teatro Campesino and Brown Berets.

55:28.739 --> 55:29.499
I would say so.

55:29.760 --> 55:30.180
Yeah.

55:30.515 --> 55:42.589
100% because what I learned at City College, you know, it brought questions to mind, okay?

55:43.570 --> 55:46.433
But there were no avenues, okay?

55:47.514 --> 55:59.087
And so when I came across the Teatro Campesino and the Brown Berets with their politicizing,

55:59.827 --> 56:06.896
that's when the doors opened and I was able to see beyond, you know, the books.

56:08.458 --> 56:11.321
So you had questions and they had answers.

56:11.722 --> 56:13.364
Yeah, basically.

56:13.384 --> 56:15.507
Okay, okay, that's interesting.

56:16.508 --> 56:26.020
I want to see, let me think if there's anything else really I want to ask about that.

56:27.907 --> 56:41.646
What do you, do you have any, do you have any kind of commentary on how you might view Chicano identity today?

56:44.510 --> 56:50.498
I know you had mentioned earlier the Chicano, Chicanx, Latinx stuff.

56:50.618 --> 56:56.867
So I was just wondering if you, like, do you see a kind of like,

56:57.893 --> 57:07.102
what do I want to call it, like a lineage between what's happening today and what was going on when you were, you know, in your early 20s being involved in these groups?

57:08.204 --> 57:18.074
You know, it's an interesting question because with the Chicano Alumni Club, we recently installed three new board of directors.

57:18.514 --> 57:20.396
They're all young, all three of them.

57:21.197 --> 57:27.343
And in between, there's this gap, you know, with the, with the,

57:28.673 --> 57:39.884
I don't want to refer to us as the oldsters, but I don't know.

57:40.785 --> 57:44.209
The way I see it is that they got the message.

57:45.330 --> 57:56.701
In between from here to over here, there were a lot of people that saw the message and understood the message to a degree, but didn't apply the message.

57:57.002 --> 57:58.343
And these youngsters have.

57:58.981 --> 58:07.963
And so they're joining us in this endeavor, you know, to keep Chicanismo alive, you know.

58:07.983 --> 58:09.767
And so one of the,

58:10.456 --> 58:21.068
One of the board members is a teacher, middle school, and she talks Chicana X and Chicano X and all that.

58:21.128 --> 58:27.636
And it's like, I don't even know if I'm saying it right, you know, because like, you know, Chicano power to me, that's all it's ever been.

58:28.437 --> 58:39.670
But there's a lot of hope and a lot of inspiration because it's a resurgence of Chicano power and Chicanismo.

58:40.325 --> 59:04.527
within the educational structure, you know, because for so many years, the educators were trying to ignore it, minimize it, you know, set it aside, you know, whatever, you know, very few people actually

59:05.536 --> 59:07.078
holding on, you know.

59:07.098 --> 59:09.200
And so I see that changing now.

59:09.220 --> 59:13.085
And when you say it, what exactly are you referring to?

59:13.145 --> 59:27.761
Do you mean like the principles of Chicanismo or are you talking about like the activity or the activism?

59:29.263 --> 59:30.244
Well, all of that.

59:30.410 --> 59:33.897
All of that was going wayward.

59:33.917 --> 59:35.640
And I see a resurgence.

59:35.680 --> 59:52.873
Just by your research here, you're one of two other people that I know of that are doing this along similar lines and wanting to know what happened in the 60s, you know, that...

59:53.275 --> 59:54.777
that piqued their interest, you know.

59:55.098 --> 01:00:01.648
And like today with the speaker over there at Arte Americas, you know, he's going to be talking about the 60s and the 70s.

01:00:03.691 --> 01:00:12.304
You know, a lot of people really didn't want to talk about that, you know, because it was a lot of turmoil and a lot of misgivings.

01:00:12.324 --> 01:00:17.292
And you're talking about, like, when you were at Fresno State in the 80s, like the mid to late 80s?

01:00:17.432 --> 01:00:18.253
Is that what you're...

01:00:18.419 --> 01:00:36.677
In the 80s, I didn't participate in anything over there because it was kind of, it was there, it was, the program was there, but there was nothing there for me, you know.

01:00:37.959 --> 01:00:43.144
And it wasn't until I had to graduate in Division IX

01:00:43.715 --> 01:00:48.268
with Chicano Latino studies, some type of class or something in that division.

01:00:49.973 --> 01:00:58.197
So I took a class from Ernesto Martinez because he's the only person that I saw knowing what the hell he was talking about, you know.

01:00:58.514 --> 01:01:06.502
And it was about the Chicano movement and stuff.

01:01:08.264 --> 01:01:19.215
So that was interesting, you know, to see it from his perspective, from an educational perspective and teaching it to other youngsters.

01:01:19.696 --> 01:01:20.877
And I'm listening.

01:01:20.897 --> 01:01:23.740
And I said, uh-huh, uh-huh.

01:01:23.760 --> 01:01:25.922
I remember, you know, I did.

01:01:26.155 --> 01:01:44.029
So now I see this resurgence and this interest coming in, where people aren't embarrassed, they're not ashamed, they want to know more, and it's not...

01:01:44.650 --> 01:01:49.196
it's not something to be embarrassed about anymore.

01:01:49.216 --> 01:01:55.244
Like it was when I was coming around, my parents were embarrassed for me, you know.

01:01:56.505 --> 01:02:00.831
And there was nothing there to be embarrassed about.

01:02:01.351 --> 01:02:03.274
I was just exposing what was there.

01:02:04.015 --> 01:02:07.780
But it was them not wanting to know, just like with the indigenous.

01:02:08.160 --> 01:02:10.563
They didn't want to know about their culture.

01:02:10.583 --> 01:02:12.666
You know, they didn't want to know about their families.

01:02:13.118 --> 01:02:14.720
because they were moving forward.

01:02:16.622 --> 01:02:17.704
And I was going back.

01:02:19.666 --> 01:02:23.531
And that's always been me, though.

01:02:24.372 --> 01:02:33.844
That's interesting to think about it that way, that your parents were maybe, because they had this

01:02:34.313 --> 01:02:39.700
It sounds like what you were saying is that they had some kind of ambition to do better.

01:02:40.020 --> 01:02:45.367
They had a drive to succeed, not only for themselves, but for their children.

01:02:45.387 --> 01:02:46.829
But for their family and stuff, yeah.

01:02:46.849 --> 01:02:53.137
And that was implanted in the minds of the people in that era.

01:02:53.337 --> 01:03:00.226
Were your parents born kind of in the 20s or maybe earlier?

01:03:00.246 --> 01:03:02.008
No, my dad was born 1921.

01:03:02.697 --> 01:03:03.980
four and my mother in 29.

01:03:05.242 --> 01:03:06.304
So they're from the twenties.

01:03:06.645 --> 01:03:07.386
Yeah.

01:03:07.406 --> 01:03:15.182
So they would have grew up kind of like at the beginning of the depression in this country that had an effect everywhere.

01:03:16.124 --> 01:03:20.773
Also the revolution is kind of like still, you know, it hasn't,

01:03:21.327 --> 01:03:23.813
Hasn't completely leveled off yet.

01:03:24.355 --> 01:03:25.057
Yeah.

01:03:25.077 --> 01:03:27.704
And what else is going on?

01:03:28.245 --> 01:03:29.027
The war.

01:03:29.167 --> 01:03:31.554
Yeah, they didn't talk about any of that stuff.

01:03:31.574 --> 01:03:32.536
Everything was real rosy.

01:03:32.957 --> 01:03:34.020
Let's sing a song.

01:03:36.177 --> 01:03:50.131
But it's interesting that that is kind of their ambition, but then you were talking about them being involved in the CSO and working with the community or doing a lot of stuff with the community.

01:03:50.552 --> 01:04:03.265
So even though they strive for us to be achievers, they still, I think, tried to hold on to

01:04:03.768 --> 01:04:05.250
what made them comfortable.

01:04:07.293 --> 01:04:09.637
Or was familiar to them.

01:04:09.737 --> 01:04:11.079
Yeah, it was familiar to them.

01:04:11.199 --> 01:04:13.663
Were they Catholics in terms of the church?

01:04:13.683 --> 01:04:15.385
Yes, they were master catechists.

01:04:16.327 --> 01:04:18.269
I grew up with all that.

01:04:18.630 --> 01:04:30.147
Out of curiosity, and also kind of going back to the mestizaje, mestizo stuff, one of the things that was

01:04:30.616 --> 01:04:57.754
a point that was coming up in some of my other interviews was about how, like, being exposed to the Virgen, the Virgen de Guadalupe, right, was kind of this early introduction to, like, mestizo or mestizaje, that, you know, that you have this kind of, like, mixture between, here's this figure who is indigenous,

01:04:59.118 --> 01:05:02.622
but is being appropriated by the Catholic Church.

01:05:03.202 --> 01:05:05.444
Oh, it goes way beyond that with me.

01:05:05.565 --> 01:05:07.286
That's my birthday, December 12th.

01:05:07.467 --> 01:05:08.588
Oh, right, right, right.

01:05:09.349 --> 01:05:09.429
Yes.

01:05:09.449 --> 01:05:13.172
According to my mother, I am the Guadalupe in the family.

01:05:13.313 --> 01:05:15.735
Everybody else is not a true Guadalupe.

01:05:17.537 --> 01:05:18.438
You know?

01:05:18.458 --> 01:05:27.387
I grew up with Guadalupe, the Virgen de Guadalupe, you know, is the holiest of the holies all my life.

01:05:27.957 --> 01:05:29.479
Because I was born on that day.

01:05:29.679 --> 01:05:30.360
Right.

01:05:30.380 --> 01:05:35.907
And so everything that my mother especially did was geared towards the Virgen.

01:05:36.628 --> 01:05:41.474
And I didn't follow that line.

01:05:42.195 --> 01:05:46.160
But later on, you know, they were involved in the church.

01:05:46.180 --> 01:05:52.548
They were part of the... Like the Guadalupanos?

01:05:52.748 --> 01:05:54.030
They were Guadalupanos, yes.

01:05:54.070 --> 01:05:55.232
They were master catechists.

01:05:55.252 --> 01:05:56.513
They were everything the church had.

01:05:57.054 --> 01:05:57.154
Okay.

01:05:57.623 --> 01:06:08.036
But they believed wholly in the Virgen de Guadalupe and what she represented to the people, you know.

01:06:08.617 --> 01:06:26.500
But curiously enough, not necessarily for the Indians, just for, you know, where my mother started from, up, you know.

01:06:26.783 --> 01:06:28.726
not down, you know.

01:06:29.407 --> 01:06:37.320
So, and even knowing that she was, you know, the patron of the, you know, the indigenous people, you know.

01:06:38.442 --> 01:06:44.612
That was true, but it was more than that, you know, according to my mother, you know.

01:06:44.632 --> 01:06:51.723
And, but she, you know, they patronized her totally.

01:06:52.284 --> 01:06:53.466
So for me,

01:06:56.078 --> 01:07:17.581
I knew about it, I knew about Juan Diego and, you know, all this stuff, but it wasn't until I got into some of the huelgas over there and marchings and stuff like that, where I saw, you know, how they, well, everything was a Virginia de Guadalupe.

01:07:17.961 --> 01:07:19.943
I could never escape her.

01:07:20.446 --> 01:07:39.079
My whole life I've never been able to escape her, you know, but it's meant so much to all the people on different lines, you know, the campesinos, you know, from one perspective, the middle class people from another perspective, you know, and just

01:07:40.122 --> 01:07:45.069
You know, the homies from another one, they get their tattoos, you know, and stuff like that.

01:07:45.810 --> 01:07:50.356
They may not be goers, but they believe, you know, and they show it.

01:07:50.376 --> 01:07:54.962
So everybody has a different way of showing their patriotism to the Vidhan, you know.

01:07:55.823 --> 01:08:01.411
And me, my mother has a Vidhan in the back over there that I can look at every day.

01:08:02.452 --> 01:08:04.375
That's the very first thing she brought into the house.

01:08:06.658 --> 01:08:07.920
You're never going to escape.

01:08:08.040 --> 01:08:09.522
No, ever.

01:08:09.856 --> 01:08:10.997
That's interesting.

01:08:11.218 --> 01:08:12.880
I was reading something.

01:08:13.120 --> 01:08:14.501
I can't remember where.

01:08:15.362 --> 01:08:31.321
It may have been from a book or something, but they were saying that a big push in Mexico, I believe, like in the early 19th century, or maybe it was in the 18th.

01:08:31.401 --> 01:08:32.182
I can't remember.

01:08:34.024 --> 01:08:37.348
But that...

01:08:37.767 --> 01:08:55.736
the kind of like popularization of the virgen that we are familiar with today was a kind of mestizo thing or, you know, from the more middle and upper class segments of Mexican society.

01:08:56.958 --> 01:09:02.887
And I don't know how, you know, how accurate that is, but kind of what you're talking about with your parents, right?

01:09:03.488 --> 01:09:04.770
That they are

01:09:05.746 --> 01:09:19.402
They sound like they want to be or they're aspiring to be that middle or upper class, whether, you know, in actuality financially or just by social status, you know.

01:09:20.343 --> 01:09:27.632
They were middle class people, you know, and that was the goal because they came from poverty.

01:09:27.652 --> 01:09:35.601
So they worked their way up from poverty and there was no way that they wanted for us to live that type of life.

01:09:35.868 --> 01:09:37.730
or be in that type of environment.

01:09:38.491 --> 01:09:41.234
I, on the other hand, wanted to know why.

01:09:43.657 --> 01:09:46.300
Why, like, what their motivations were, or?

01:09:46.420 --> 01:09:46.821
Why not?

01:09:48.182 --> 01:09:48.943
What's there?

01:09:49.664 --> 01:09:50.305
Uh-huh.

01:09:50.605 --> 01:09:53.469
Like, why is it, what's so wrong with it?

01:09:53.869 --> 01:09:54.370
Yes.

01:09:55.191 --> 01:10:00.036
What is it that you're not wanting to see?

01:10:00.277 --> 01:10:00.597
You know?

01:10:01.538 --> 01:10:03.661
But that was me, you know?

01:10:03.681 --> 01:10:04.862
And my parents...

01:10:05.956 --> 01:10:08.178
I never understood that really.

01:10:08.679 --> 01:10:12.063
My mother was like, why?

01:10:13.845 --> 01:10:17.529
They always wanted to know what I was looking for, I guess.

01:10:17.549 --> 01:10:20.813
And that was part of the thing with the Teatro Campesino.

01:10:20.833 --> 01:10:24.677
They went over there and they wanted to know, what the hell are you involved in?

01:10:24.997 --> 01:10:26.759
And they sat there and they listened.

01:10:26.779 --> 01:10:29.502
They listened to all these vulgar words and stuff like that.

01:10:31.124 --> 01:10:32.125
They said, come on, let's go.

01:10:32.225 --> 01:10:32.906
Let's get out of here.

01:10:32.926 --> 01:10:34.748
No, I'm not going anywhere, man.

01:10:34.998 --> 01:10:37.381
I wasn't going anywhere.

01:10:37.982 --> 01:10:41.766
They sound a lot like my grandparents, sort of, kind of.

01:10:43.028 --> 01:10:48.315
My grandparents were... Well, my grandma was very religious.

01:10:49.056 --> 01:10:50.277
My grandpa, not so much.

01:10:50.377 --> 01:10:59.128
But they very much wanted a kind of middle-class, American dream type of life.

01:11:00.069 --> 01:11:02.873
And I hear that a lot from people in their generation.

01:11:02.893 --> 01:11:04.515
They're also born in the 20s.

01:11:05.457 --> 01:11:11.787
with, you know, parents who are from Mexico and they're born here.

01:11:11.968 --> 01:11:21.884
And so it's interesting to see kind of like similar, similar points of view, you know, from different families.

01:11:22.685 --> 01:11:23.186
Yeah.

01:11:23.206 --> 01:11:29.997
Well, you know, I, I, I have had my,

01:11:31.276 --> 01:11:57.351
experience poverty experiences but i knew that i would never stay there and to me this is my castle you know and this is about the best that i'll ever do and i don't need more you know i'm not searching for more you know and and i think that's with some people you know i don't know why they keep i don't know where they're going you know but

01:11:57.702 --> 01:12:05.376
I don't know if that comes with age where you finally decide that, you know, okay, this is it, you know.

01:12:05.937 --> 01:12:11.708
But I preach my happiness, you know.

01:12:13.551 --> 01:12:18.580
That doesn't mean that, you know, I can't win a lottery and stuff like that.

01:12:19.235 --> 01:12:21.217
You can't go to Chauncey and try.

01:12:21.538 --> 01:12:21.838
No.

01:12:22.759 --> 01:12:33.792
But anyway, yeah, you know, I am who I am because of where I come from and experienced and chose to be around, you know.

01:12:33.832 --> 01:12:34.053
Yeah.

01:12:34.793 --> 01:12:46.007
And so I offer this to people now, you know, and just like with my buttons, it's my venture and my experience, the chicanismo.

01:12:46.988 --> 01:12:48.870
And it's going to be on display over there at the banquet.

01:12:49.829 --> 01:13:16.545
nice when is that banquet it's september 14th oh okay yeah nice so um yeah i'll i'll let you see them and uh yeah that'd be great um yeah so i can't uh i mean those are my two kind of main questions and i think uh we've got some good good stuff here is there anything else you would like to say or add and

01:13:17.403 --> 01:13:22.989
to be recorded for posterity?

01:13:23.009 --> 01:13:25.592
No.

01:13:25.612 --> 01:13:28.054
No, it just, my brother showed me a lot.

01:13:28.074 --> 01:13:30.897
The teatro showed me a lot.

01:13:32.979 --> 01:13:35.722
The family showed me a lot, you know.

01:13:38.785 --> 01:13:46.313
And I just hope that, you know,

01:13:48.335 --> 01:13:50.458
Chicanismo lives on.

01:13:50.478 --> 01:13:54.205
The Mestizos men are here and they've never gone.

01:13:54.345 --> 01:13:56.368
They've always been here, you know?

01:13:57.590 --> 01:14:12.334
And people, they need to know where they come from because the circle isn't completed until you've gone full circle and found out who you are now.

01:14:13.833 --> 01:14:21.702
From your little speech right there, I was like, oh, I'm going to ask about that.

01:14:22.303 --> 01:14:26.428
No, but you just invoked that word mestizos, right?

01:14:26.628 --> 01:14:28.590
What does that mean to you?

01:14:28.610 --> 01:14:29.771
What is a mestizo?

01:14:29.792 --> 01:14:32.975
A Chicano?

01:14:34.177 --> 01:14:35.859
It's more than a Chicano.

01:14:35.879 --> 01:14:37.140
A mestizo is...

01:14:38.234 --> 01:14:40.897
our beginning, you know.

01:14:42.219 --> 01:14:52.430
It's a branch of our beginning and way back, you know, with some people.

01:14:55.134 --> 01:14:58.217
Not everybody wants to go back, you know.

01:14:59.158 --> 01:15:05.085
Not everybody's happy with knowing about their indigenousness

01:15:06.027 --> 01:15:08.551
the raping of our culture and stuff like that.

01:15:10.473 --> 01:15:16.723
Some people are just happy staying blind, I suppose.

01:15:20.087 --> 01:15:30.162
But you are who you are and we've experienced a lot and we continue to experience a lot, especially right now with this

01:15:31.610 --> 01:16:00.925
knucklehead of a leader trying to break us just like they were trying to break us in the past nothing's changed we're right here where we were 50 years ago 50 years from that it's all recycling and you have to you have to become educated about

01:16:02.137 --> 01:16:14.637
about yourself, about your family, about your history, you know, and show pride, you know.

01:16:15.077 --> 01:16:19.484
I've never left the Chicano culture.

01:16:20.145 --> 01:16:22.649
I've never ever not been a Chicana.

01:16:23.010 --> 01:16:26.355
1969, I became

01:16:28.158 --> 01:16:33.825
and use the word Chicano for the first time, and it's never left my life.

01:16:35.948 --> 01:16:37.370
Because once you are, you are.

01:16:38.491 --> 01:16:54.993
And it's all encompassing of what it means to be Native, what it means to be Spaniard, what it means to be Mexican.

01:16:56.976 --> 01:16:58.097
It's all encompassing.

01:16:58.448 --> 01:17:00.491
We're all of that.

01:17:00.511 --> 01:17:18.638
And it's just like with myself, I'm just trying to be happy living with who I am because I've gone back to find my family members, you know, and some of it is not pretty.

01:17:19.640 --> 01:17:21.282
The Olguín name is not pretty.

01:17:23.686 --> 01:17:25.789
Spaniard, you know.

01:17:26.883 --> 01:17:30.889
And there's a lot of ugliness that comes with it.

01:17:31.570 --> 01:17:41.245
But it's accepting it and moving on and finding yourself, I guess.

01:17:41.345 --> 01:17:43.048
And that's what I've been trying to do.

01:17:43.068 --> 01:17:44.229
Of course, my daughter doesn't care.

01:17:44.249 --> 01:17:55.827
It's really different because you care so much as a person, but your child may not.

01:17:56.060 --> 01:17:57.101
your grandchild may.

01:17:58.783 --> 01:18:01.785
So you never know where it's gonna hit.

01:18:03.487 --> 01:18:10.654
And just like with my parents, they didn't care so much to know, but I did.

01:18:11.114 --> 01:18:25.628
And it hurts me to say about my child, it's like, okay, but it's not that they don't understand or they don't see, it's just that they choose to, you know,

01:18:26.165 --> 01:18:52.240
skate over it you know yeah and there's a there's a lot of that yeah and so with this project that you have and with the project that they've been working on over here at the arte with that to me that shows hope you know and uh you know that you know that

01:18:52.658 --> 01:18:54.360
We're survivors.

01:18:54.601 --> 01:18:56.263
And so that's how I see it.

01:18:56.624 --> 01:18:58.086
We're survivors.

01:18:58.627 --> 01:19:01.050
And we always will be.

01:19:03.914 --> 01:19:04.916
Are we done?

01:19:05.216 --> 01:19:05.757
We're done?

01:19:05.777 --> 01:19:06.138
I guess so.

01:19:08.121 --> 01:19:08.541
All right.

01:19:08.601 --> 01:19:09.823
Thank you, Lupe.
