WEBVTT

00:00.031 --> 00:00.832
Let's see.

00:00.992 --> 00:02.033
Okay.

00:02.053 --> 00:06.559
So I'm here with Aurora Cuevedo.

00:06.579 --> 00:06.859
Yes.

00:07.359 --> 00:07.920
Quevedo.

00:07.940 --> 00:09.262
Quevedo.

00:09.282 --> 00:09.922
Quevedo.

00:11.144 --> 00:12.525
It's like queso.

00:12.545 --> 00:13.346
Like queso.

00:13.567 --> 00:15.749
Okay.

00:15.769 --> 00:19.453
And I can't like, for the life of me, I'm like Aurora.

00:19.814 --> 00:20.995
Aurora.

00:21.556 --> 00:22.897
Aurora.

00:22.917 --> 00:24.499
You know, you know, pot of tea.

00:24.860 --> 00:25.500
Pot of tea.

00:25.520 --> 00:26.201
Pot of tea.

00:26.381 --> 00:26.882
Pot of tea.

00:27.102 --> 00:27.743
There's your R.

00:28.162 --> 00:29.305
Aurora.

00:29.325 --> 00:31.410
It's just like a party.

00:31.430 --> 00:32.353
Aurora.

00:32.373 --> 00:33.536
You've got it.

00:33.857 --> 00:35.060
Okay.

00:35.080 --> 00:38.910
Every time I want to say it, I feel my tongue.

00:38.930 --> 00:40.414
Because it's a single flap.

00:40.434 --> 00:41.837
They call it a single flap bar.

00:42.820 --> 00:44.905
And it's...

00:46.100 --> 00:47.062
It's there.

00:47.584 --> 00:48.726
It's just English.

00:49.027 --> 00:52.937
Anglophones don't know that they have a single flat heart.

00:53.959 --> 00:54.561
But now you do.

00:55.122 --> 00:55.804
All right.

00:56.345 --> 00:57.387
So we're here.

00:58.650 --> 01:04.665
It's August 12th, and we are in Fresno, in the countryside of Fresno.

01:06.113 --> 01:08.596
Southwest Fresno.

01:08.616 --> 01:09.858
Southwest Fresno.

01:09.878 --> 01:11.379
El Fresno de la Gente.

01:11.400 --> 01:11.760
Yes.

01:14.003 --> 01:25.016
So we kind of talked a little bit about my project, and I have really these kind of two basic questions that then kind of lead off into a whole bunch of other questions.

01:26.418 --> 01:34.568
So maybe we can start with, how about you telling us your name and your project?

01:35.138 --> 01:36.719
your age or your birthday.

01:38.381 --> 01:52.053
My name is Aurora Martinez, Flores Hermosa, Villa de Moros, Michel.

01:53.154 --> 02:05.044
So, Martinez, Villa de Moros on my father's side in Mexico City all his life, and Flores Hermosa, Michel on my mother's side

02:05.480 --> 02:19.876
My mother was born in the U.S., in Oakland, because my grandpa brought his family of 10 kids and wife to the States around the time, at the tail end of the Mexican Revolution.

02:20.957 --> 02:24.401
And everybody had been born in Mexico, eight of them.

02:25.342 --> 02:33.190
But my mother and her sibling is right next to her, Tia Violeta, were born in Oakland.

02:33.871 --> 02:34.812
And...

02:35.585 --> 02:41.670
When my mother, then my grandpa and the babies went back to Mexico.

02:41.690 --> 02:47.315
And so they lived in Mexico for a couple of years.

02:47.596 --> 02:53.561
So when my mom was five and my Tia Violeta was about seven, somehow they were back.

02:53.621 --> 02:54.982
I don't quite know the story.

02:55.042 --> 02:58.425
I have to talk to Tia Violeta before she leaves.

02:59.306 --> 03:00.367
They were back in Oakland.

03:00.387 --> 03:01.728
My grandmother passed away.

03:02.749 --> 03:04.731
And so when my grandmother passed away,

03:05.588 --> 03:10.113
My grandfather couldn't care for them for some reason.

03:10.894 --> 03:17.341
And she gave my mother and Tia Violeta to the oldest daughter, Tia Carmelita.

03:17.361 --> 03:19.343
They lived in San Francisco at the time.

03:20.865 --> 03:28.173
And so she was, after age five or six, she was raised in San Francisco until she was about 15.

03:28.213 --> 03:32.558
She went back to visit grandpa in Mexico City, met my dad.

03:32.960 --> 03:34.041
in Mexico City.

03:34.061 --> 03:43.050
He took her horseback riding and brought her serenatas and they fell in love and they got married.

03:43.090 --> 03:44.712
She was about 17.

03:44.772 --> 03:47.775
She was about 26.

03:48.276 --> 03:50.278
He was almost 10 years older than she was.

03:52.560 --> 03:55.183
But in those days it was not necessarily uncommon.

03:55.844 --> 03:59.187
But to my grandpa's

04:00.382 --> 04:03.866
uh, non-conforming of the marriage they married.

04:04.807 --> 04:18.641
And, um, so my mom stayed in Mexico for the next, um, probably close to 20 years, 18 or so years, raised her family of four children.

04:19.602 --> 04:27.310
And, uh, actually he, she divorced my, uh, my dad when I was three, he drank quite a bit.

04:27.671 --> 04:29.933
He's a well-educated,

04:30.301 --> 04:34.406
engineer that the whole family drank a lot, my uncles.

04:35.587 --> 04:43.397
And so she divorced him, but she raised four kids in Mexico City, you know, in the 40s and 50s.

04:44.038 --> 04:45.920
That wasn't a small feat.

04:45.940 --> 04:51.267
And I always remember she always worked.

04:51.287 --> 04:59.076
She either had a mechanic shop or she had a paint store, you know, paint for painting for the houses and stuff.

04:59.680 --> 05:06.947
So she stayed in Mexico until my grandpa died when I was 15.

05:07.927 --> 05:20.639
And then at that point, she would say, well, heaven knows all that she had to do to get us immigration papers because she had her, you know, her dual citizenship.

05:20.779 --> 05:24.763
It was a little easier for her, but it still took her years to get us a green card.

05:25.443 --> 05:27.685
And so we came in a bus from Mexico City.

05:28.066 --> 05:28.506
Wow.

05:28.823 --> 05:29.884
with my mom.

05:30.405 --> 05:34.850
She sold everything that we owned, including my folklorico dresses.

05:35.651 --> 05:37.353
I had a collection because I used to dance.

05:38.414 --> 05:53.552
She sold everything, every stitch of furniture, everything that she owned to get us the bus tickets to make the Al Norte, to reunify with her siblings.

05:53.912 --> 05:58.037
So there was one brother that stayed in Mexico City.

05:58.270 --> 06:00.073
Two brothers, but one had passed away.

06:00.213 --> 06:01.875
The eldest had passed away.

06:01.895 --> 06:06.862
So one brother and his three daughters stayed in Mexico City.

06:06.882 --> 06:09.366
And then everybody else was over here.

06:09.386 --> 06:09.646
Wow.

06:09.886 --> 06:11.669
Brothers and sisters, big family.

06:11.869 --> 06:15.835
So you and your three siblings were born in Mexico City.

06:15.855 --> 06:16.115
Yes.

06:16.135 --> 06:17.016
Is that correct?

06:17.037 --> 06:18.999
And when's your birthday?

06:19.079 --> 06:19.700
How old are you?

06:19.800 --> 06:22.124
January 7th, 1947.

06:22.424 --> 06:25.268
I'm 72 and a half plus.

06:25.288 --> 06:25.689
Wow.

06:26.510 --> 06:26.590
Wow.

06:26.857 --> 06:33.366
And then so you kind of talked about your early childhood being in Mexico, Mexico City.

06:34.047 --> 06:34.147
Yeah.

06:34.167 --> 06:35.749
And then you guys came up.

06:35.789 --> 06:37.372
How old were you when you guys came?

06:37.412 --> 06:44.161
We came in November, and by January I turned 16.

06:44.462 --> 06:44.882
Oh, wow.

06:44.922 --> 06:46.184
So I was 15 plus.

06:46.204 --> 06:49.388
So you spent pretty much all of your childhood.

06:49.409 --> 06:49.589
Oh, yeah.

06:49.989 --> 06:50.270
Wow.

06:50.290 --> 06:51.872
I came with lots of literacy.

06:53.234 --> 06:53.374
Mm-hmm.

06:53.715 --> 06:55.497
Lots of...

06:55.983 --> 07:02.750
center in terms of, you know, I was very proud to be Mexican.

07:03.010 --> 07:09.236
I was very, very strong in my language, you know, strong math.

07:09.777 --> 07:21.068
I was raised in Mexican public schools, and I haven't said this in a long time, but I used to be very proud of my junior high.

07:22.890 --> 07:24.792
In junior high, in the

07:25.902 --> 07:27.584
Seventh, eighth, and ninth.

07:27.864 --> 07:33.490
In the seventh grade, we had nine different subjects.

07:34.671 --> 07:40.396
And the eighth grade, we had... The eighth grade was the toughest.

07:40.496 --> 07:42.198
We had 13 different subjects.

07:43.039 --> 07:46.262
And in the ninth grade, we had 11 different subjects.

07:46.863 --> 07:55.251
So we had, you know, from home ec to foreign language to science to...

07:57.239 --> 08:00.002
world history.

08:00.483 --> 08:06.170
We had physics in the eighth grade, we had chemistry in the ninth grade.

08:07.051 --> 08:07.852
It was different.

08:07.872 --> 08:20.428
I think that they have changed the system a little bit, but back then in the fifties, the junior high, the secondary curriculum was very

08:21.353 --> 08:23.536
very intense.

08:25.499 --> 08:29.685
We went to school six days a week, including Saturdays.

08:29.705 --> 08:36.135
Some of the PE and home ec and things like that happened on the weekends.

08:37.416 --> 08:41.202
We had, interestingly, we had what we now call

08:41.823 --> 08:57.368
in uh in the u.s block schedule yeah are you familiar with that no i mean i've heard of it but so instead of having uh five or six 50-minute periods you have six or seven um

08:58.833 --> 09:00.176
two to three hour blocks.

09:01.479 --> 09:04.406
And so you go more intensely into the subject.

09:05.207 --> 09:07.312
And so you don't go to the same class.

09:08.234 --> 09:10.860
You go to different classes different days of the week.

09:11.361 --> 09:14.749
So on Mondays, Wednesdays, Fridays, you have

09:15.083 --> 09:27.581
certain classes, a little more like, you know, what we do in college, except in order to fit that many subjects, you know, they, back then in the fifties, they had actually had block schedules.

09:27.601 --> 09:28.142
Yeah.

09:28.162 --> 09:29.644
You know, but it was six days a week.

09:30.185 --> 09:40.900
And it's interesting too, because I know after the, the Mexican revolution, there was a lot of investment, government investment into education.

09:40.920 --> 09:41.481
Public schools.

09:41.501 --> 09:41.862
Yeah.

09:41.902 --> 09:42.002
Yeah.

09:42.235 --> 09:45.860
So it's interesting to hear you kind of talk about that.

09:46.301 --> 09:47.463
What it was like to live it.

09:47.763 --> 09:48.564
Right, right.

09:48.584 --> 09:49.105
Guess what?

09:49.966 --> 09:54.132
My brother and sister, I'm number three of the four of us.

09:54.773 --> 09:58.959
My brother opened the junior high.

09:59.280 --> 10:06.490
There was no secundaria in Coyoacan, is where I'm from, in Mexico City, which is in the south of the city, near the university.

10:06.510 --> 10:06.811
Right.

10:07.552 --> 10:11.297
And they had him...

10:12.728 --> 10:18.534
bring, my mom had to have a carpintero build him a desk.

10:18.975 --> 10:19.816
You know, a pupitre?

10:20.256 --> 10:28.065
A chair with the old-fashioned, with the wooden pallet thing that comes around, you scoot into.

10:28.685 --> 10:35.733
So when he started, he was the first class of the secundaria diurna 35, number 35.

10:36.614 --> 10:40.558
And diurna meaning it was the morning because they had double.

10:40.960 --> 10:48.429
sessions, they had secundaria in the morning and they had another group in the afternoon, evening.

10:49.230 --> 10:53.975
And so ours was diurna, which is, it was daily and it was in the morning.

10:54.956 --> 10:56.899
And he had to bring his desk.

10:58.300 --> 11:04.167
And my sister was the second group, Rosa Marta, she had to bring a desk.

11:04.231 --> 11:08.597
By the time I got there the following year, they had enough desks.

11:08.858 --> 11:09.338
Oh, wow.

11:09.418 --> 11:12.443
And so I didn't have to bring a desk, but they had to bring a desk.

11:12.763 --> 11:13.925
My mom had to have a capping.

11:13.945 --> 11:14.846
They don't make a desk.

11:16.589 --> 11:17.330
Neat.

11:17.350 --> 11:23.218
Okay, so you and your family, your mom and your siblings were all in Mexico City.

11:23.705 --> 11:26.468
Until you were about 16, you said, is that right?

11:26.488 --> 11:28.050
Almost shy, a couple of months.

11:28.411 --> 11:28.811
Yeah.

11:28.851 --> 11:31.494
So would that have been like 1962, 1963?

11:31.534 --> 11:34.438
November of 1963.

11:34.778 --> 11:35.719
All right.

11:36.260 --> 11:39.163
And then where did you guys come?

11:39.203 --> 11:42.327
Did you guys go back to the Bay Area where her siblings were?

11:42.347 --> 11:45.711
We went straight to my first, my mother.

11:45.871 --> 11:47.753
Remember, my mother is from a family of 10.

11:47.813 --> 11:48.514
She was the baby.

11:48.781 --> 11:50.302
She was the baby of all of them.

11:51.003 --> 11:57.689
So, and remember my mother's oldest sister raised her and Auntie Violet.

11:57.749 --> 12:02.054
So she was a woman married when they were babies.

12:02.114 --> 12:03.995
So grandma was still having babies, right?

12:04.015 --> 12:04.216
Yeah.

12:04.236 --> 12:05.357
It's kind of typical.

12:05.537 --> 12:06.318
Yeah.

12:06.978 --> 12:18.349
And she, she was, I lost my train of thought.

12:18.886 --> 12:22.450
You're talking about your mother.

12:23.172 --> 12:27.017
Like where you guys went, came back to in the U.S.

12:27.478 --> 12:29.180
So she reunified with her.

12:29.621 --> 12:35.389
So, but, you know, we can gather, my mom and we never, I wish we had talked more.

12:35.409 --> 12:35.990
Mm-hmm.

12:36.010 --> 12:39.835
But she had a support system over here.

12:40.596 --> 12:40.737
Mm-hmm.

12:40.757 --> 12:49.389
And so there had been an agreement that Auntie Dolores, who was really not my auntie, she's my first cousin Dolores.

12:49.709 --> 12:49.849
Mm-hmm.

12:50.470 --> 12:51.912
Who was my mother's age.

12:52.133 --> 12:52.453
Mm-hmm.

12:52.906 --> 12:55.249
because Auntie Carmen didn't have any children.

12:55.269 --> 13:00.556
The one that raised the girls didn't have any children, but Auntie Katie had a daughter, Dolores.

13:01.678 --> 13:07.506
And so Dolores sponsored us because in those days you had to be sponsored by someone.

13:07.986 --> 13:16.638
And so, um, Dolores and her family, um, took us into their house.

13:16.658 --> 13:20.483
We lived in her basement in, uh,

13:20.851 --> 13:26.497
In Piedmont Hills, which is at the time, it was a very segregated part of Oakland.

13:27.438 --> 13:34.225
As a matter of fact, my sister and I were the only Latinas in the whole school in Oakland, in Piedmont High.

13:34.706 --> 13:37.208
And segregated with whites?

13:37.289 --> 13:38.510
Totally.

13:38.570 --> 13:42.935
Almost 100, well, it was probably 99% white.

13:43.675 --> 13:46.118
There were two Japanese brother and sister.

13:47.880 --> 13:49.862
There were two African-American brothers.

13:50.230 --> 13:55.417
I can't remember if they were, I think they were both girls and my sister and me.

13:55.637 --> 14:07.173
We were in the school newspaper because we were not a D. And then, of course, after that, the schools, you know, totally desegregated.

14:07.193 --> 14:08.635
Right.

14:08.655 --> 14:10.958
But you would think it was a different world, you know.

14:11.459 --> 14:15.765
So we, once my mom, my mom,

14:16.471 --> 14:21.941
It got a job through Auntie Dolores, too, my cousin Dolores, waitressing.

14:23.124 --> 14:26.250
And she pretty much stayed with waitressing.

14:26.270 --> 14:29.556
That's how she pulled us through.

14:29.576 --> 14:35.307
I remember she used to sit on the bed and count her pennies and quarters and dimes, her...

14:35.928 --> 14:37.310
Her tips.

14:37.470 --> 14:37.870
Yeah.

14:37.890 --> 14:41.054
That's mostly what she raised us.

14:41.615 --> 14:50.706
But so when she was able to save a little bit of money, we lived with another first cousin, Uncle Mike.

14:51.406 --> 15:04.602
So we went from Piedmont three months, and then we went down right below Piedmont to my cousin Miguel and his family, and they took us in for a

15:04.818 --> 15:07.141
I think we were there only a few weeks.

15:07.922 --> 15:09.164
I don't think it was that long.

15:10.846 --> 15:13.750
Maybe a matter of a month or so.

15:14.692 --> 15:25.006
And she found a house across the street from Oakland High and moved into our little Casa Verde across the street from the school.

15:25.607 --> 15:28.050
Went to the old Oakland High before they tore it down.

15:28.070 --> 15:30.934
They tore all those old beautiful schools down.

15:31.275 --> 15:32.817
And we graduated from Oakland High.

15:33.539 --> 15:34.100
Nice.

15:34.120 --> 15:49.364
And the, probably, I say this, I think it's more of an urban legend type of memory on my part, but I always say that the day after graduation, my mom packed us in the car and we came to San Jose.

15:49.985 --> 15:50.907
Oh, wow.

15:50.927 --> 15:53.150
Because that's where my mom bought a house.

15:54.252 --> 15:57.978
I don't know if you're familiar with San Jose King and Story.

15:57.998 --> 15:59.040
Yeah.

15:59.140 --> 16:00.642
That's where I'm from, San Jose.

16:01.083 --> 16:01.183
Okay.

16:01.467 --> 16:22.018
So if you go into Tully, between Tully and King Road, on the east side of King Road, it's a huge... It was the new area that was called Tropicana.

16:22.038 --> 16:22.278
Yeah.

16:22.699 --> 16:26.344
And so my mom was, you know, I mean, she paid something like...

16:26.476 --> 16:30.483
$15,000 or something for her little casita en la Tropicana.

16:30.904 --> 16:31.845
Mi esposo Jesús.

16:32.406 --> 16:33.007
Hello.

16:34.770 --> 16:35.031
How are you?

16:35.051 --> 16:40.821
Rocio is, I think, didn't you meet her dad?

16:41.522 --> 16:42.143
Yeah.

16:42.183 --> 16:43.606
With the long ponytail?

16:43.766 --> 16:46.952
Last weekend at the play.

16:47.753 --> 16:48.975
Oh, we were at the play.

16:49.276 --> 16:50.037
Okay, yeah.

16:50.489 --> 16:55.375
He's the friend from San Jose that I tell you.

16:55.515 --> 16:57.698
Remember his property flooded?

16:57.758 --> 17:02.063
The river overtook his property in Modesto?

17:02.083 --> 17:03.204
Oh, that's right.

17:03.244 --> 17:05.147
He was telling you about his two tractors.

17:05.167 --> 17:05.887
Oh, the tractors.

17:05.927 --> 17:07.730
They were talking tractors.

17:07.830 --> 17:09.652
He's been up on the tractor this morning.

17:09.672 --> 17:11.614
Look at them.

17:11.714 --> 17:14.157
Hey, it keeps you going.

17:14.177 --> 17:15.158
It keeps you busy, huh?

17:16.160 --> 17:17.822
Yeah, a lot to do.

17:17.842 --> 17:18.943
And so...

17:19.042 --> 17:30.657
So the day after graduation, urban legend, we moved to San Jose and right away, right away, you know, get a job, get a job.

17:31.157 --> 17:35.983
So my sister and I, my mom was working.

17:36.003 --> 17:41.370
So my sister and I got on the bus and we, and we went to the

17:42.413 --> 18:10.429
the um at the time what was the employment office called at the time i think it was employment office yeah i'm not sure now they call it human resources development so we we went to the employment development department yeah yeah so we went to the the employment office and um we were invited to go through some training

18:11.405 --> 18:24.466
And so we participated in the Manpower Development and Training Act, MDTA.

18:24.506 --> 18:26.470
It was pretty big in those days.

18:27.251 --> 18:30.797
And it was a training program to give you job skills.

18:31.618 --> 18:35.404
So in order for us to qualify, we just graduated from high school.

18:35.823 --> 18:38.665
my sister held herself back.

18:39.386 --> 18:40.367
She could have graduated.

18:40.968 --> 18:42.449
I went straight into the 10th grade.

18:42.469 --> 18:45.211
She went into the 10th grade with me.

18:45.692 --> 18:47.153
I had just finished my 9th grade.

18:47.173 --> 18:53.118
She had just finished her 10th grade in Mexico, but she was a little bit more shy than I. I'm not shy.

18:54.539 --> 18:55.580
So she wanted to be with you.

18:55.600 --> 19:00.304
She wanted to be with me, and so she held herself back, and my mom agreed to that.

19:00.945 --> 19:03.167
And so we graduated together in 1965.

19:03.727 --> 19:05.509
And so we went

19:05.658 --> 19:07.520
to the employment office in San Jose.

19:08.221 --> 19:14.027
And they offered us, um, this MDTA train clerk typist training program.

19:15.348 --> 19:17.551
And, uh, it was a one year program.

19:17.591 --> 19:29.123
They, they taught us basic accounting, um, and, uh, typing, um, clerking, you know, in general.

19:29.143 --> 19:34.028
And, um, from there,

19:35.712 --> 19:46.144
My clerk instructor was very pushy with me that she wanted me to consider.

19:46.799 --> 19:51.486
school, which is something that I was very interested in.

19:51.526 --> 19:56.132
But my high school counselor told me I was going to make a good cook and a good waitress if I graduated.

19:57.554 --> 19:58.555
Sounds typical.

19:58.576 --> 20:03.202
And so it didn't take a lot of convincing.

20:04.043 --> 20:07.748
So she kind of pushed you towards going to university or college?

20:07.768 --> 20:09.250
Well, she came to class one day.

20:09.270 --> 20:10.933
It was a one-year training program.

20:11.814 --> 20:12.555
I finished it.

20:12.575 --> 20:16.080
I got my little certificate.

20:16.448 --> 20:21.540
She came over to school one day and she had the app and she sat with me.

20:21.561 --> 20:25.610
We completed the app and I went straight to San Jose State.

20:25.771 --> 20:27.876
I got accepted, yeah.

20:28.058 --> 20:29.300
Great.

20:30.161 --> 20:42.678
So perhaps that will take me to my kind of first big question, which is, do you consider yourself to be a participant in the Chicano movement?

20:43.479 --> 20:48.245
And if so, what did you see as your role or how did you participate?

20:50.969 --> 20:56.817
My first, yes, I do consider myself

20:57.100 --> 21:03.610
to have been intuitively dissatisfied.

21:04.371 --> 21:06.534
I was very satisfied with my high school counselor.

21:07.576 --> 21:10.520
I held a grudge for a long time.

21:10.540 --> 21:15.868
I'll tell you later how I let go of it.

21:19.392 --> 21:41.454
When I was at San Jose State, it was pre-EOP, Economic Opportunity Program, which is the program that first came into the state university system to help with tuition and tutoring and things to bring more diversity into the state system, not only San Jose State.

21:41.775 --> 21:44.978
And so this was pre-EOP, but in order

21:44.958 --> 21:52.065
For that to come about, there was quite a bit of activism on the campus.

21:53.687 --> 21:54.488
There was a club.

22:00.254 --> 22:02.776
Chicano, what was the name of the club?

22:07.741 --> 22:10.404
I'll think of the name or I'll get you the name.

22:10.944 --> 22:14.408
But there was a group of students that were older than me.

22:14.827 --> 22:25.323
A lot of the kids that I hung out with were older than me because I ended up majoring in English and in Spanish and minored in linguistics.

22:25.964 --> 22:38.083
And so my Spanish major, although I was a freshman, I was taking upper division in Spanish classes because they placed me.

22:39.110 --> 22:46.482
at upper division level because I had, you know, the strong literate skills that I brought with me from Mexico.

22:47.163 --> 22:50.889
So they didn't make me start with lower division Spanish.

22:51.029 --> 22:58.861
I did some testing and they gave me credit, not units, but they gave me knowledge credit.

22:58.901 --> 23:01.305
And so I was able to start upper division.

23:01.866 --> 23:05.151
And so I had kids that were two, three, four years older than me.

23:09.805 --> 23:15.597
And so they were the Ramon Martinez's of the group.

23:15.617 --> 23:20.627
Ramon is only two, three, four years older than I am, just slightly.

23:22.010 --> 23:23.614
The TV went on.

23:23.634 --> 23:26.820
Oh, this truck.

23:26.840 --> 23:28.624
Oh, I was watching MSNC.

23:29.752 --> 23:54.514
So there was quite a bit of student involvement in that.

23:55.175 --> 23:59.539
It wants to be on.

24:01.021 --> 24:03.103
The spirits want to watch TV?

24:06.447 --> 24:08.990
My brother and mom wants to watch TV.

24:10.252 --> 24:13.415
Oh, here's another woman that you might want to meet.

24:13.435 --> 24:14.517
She's right here in Fresno.

24:14.797 --> 24:17.200
Her name is Diana Gaspar Pena.

24:17.620 --> 24:22.366
She's an artist, and she's a very interesting woman.

24:24.288 --> 24:27.051
Diana Gaspar Pena.

24:27.852 --> 24:30.555
She came from the Bay Area too.

24:32.122 --> 24:37.791
Okay, so you were talking about being at San Jose State.

24:37.971 --> 24:39.874
Campus activism.

24:40.255 --> 24:41.236
Were you there?

24:41.376 --> 24:42.097
Did you go there?

24:42.919 --> 24:44.301
Would that have been around 1967?

24:44.461 --> 24:48.547
I started in 66.

24:48.567 --> 24:51.772
Oh, okay.

24:51.792 --> 24:53.756
So campus activism.

24:53.836 --> 24:54.096
Uh-huh.

24:54.700 --> 25:02.134
And is this, is it Chicano activism or is it more like anti-war?

25:02.174 --> 25:16.101
Because I've been hearing a lot from my interviews that there is, yeah, that there's like almost, it's like there was this initial anti-war sentiment that then got kind of like funneled into politics.

25:16.503 --> 25:17.684
Chicano stuff?

25:17.704 --> 25:19.286
No, I think it was the other way.

25:19.306 --> 25:40.992
No, the whole campus was vibrating with anti-war, but within our Spanish language group, foreign languages in general, there was a group that wanted to have

25:41.191 --> 25:42.713
We didn't want to be invincible.

25:43.154 --> 25:44.295
Invisible, excuse me.

25:44.315 --> 25:44.756
Invisible.

25:44.836 --> 25:45.336
Invisible.

25:46.218 --> 25:48.781
We did cultural events.

25:52.025 --> 25:58.153
We organized a group that brought us together.

25:59.174 --> 26:01.137
You know, we shared food together.

26:01.317 --> 26:06.103
We talked about our struggles in classes.

26:06.384 --> 26:10.489
Our, you know, I mean, my...

26:10.807 --> 26:15.173
My English was about three years old at the time.

26:15.613 --> 26:20.960
And, you know, I struggled through it kind of on my own.

26:20.980 --> 26:23.844
And so did everybody else.

26:24.304 --> 26:33.035
And both in basic math, basic, not basic math, basic English and the history classes were very difficult for me.

26:34.577 --> 26:35.358
The U.S.

26:35.419 --> 26:37.561
history was somewhat new to me.

26:37.581 --> 26:38.923
You know, it was about three years old.

26:39.578 --> 26:39.938
Yeah.

26:40.659 --> 26:42.541
Three years of U.S.

26:42.561 --> 26:43.982
history that I'd had.

26:44.022 --> 26:51.950
I'd had a little bit in the Mexican schools, but not the depth that I needed in order to succeed at the college level.

26:52.350 --> 26:53.231
Right.

26:53.451 --> 26:55.333
In the history classes for general.

26:55.413 --> 26:56.274
Right.

26:56.294 --> 27:04.101
And I remember talking to each other about becoming, we actually became a support group to each other.

27:05.102 --> 27:06.823
You know, I helped people with their Spanish.

27:06.884 --> 27:08.505
They helped me with my English.

27:09.008 --> 27:11.710
So-and-so helped so-and-fulanita with their math.

27:12.071 --> 27:13.332
I did some helping with math.

27:13.352 --> 27:15.173
Just kind of like peer mentoring.

27:15.213 --> 27:17.615
We did that kind of intuitively.

27:18.456 --> 27:21.339
You know, the university wasn't giving it to us.

27:21.519 --> 27:21.839
Right.

27:22.159 --> 27:31.728
And some of us were struggling in different areas, but we were all very talented, more so in some areas than in others, right?

27:31.748 --> 27:32.208
Right.

27:32.228 --> 27:34.150
And so we kind of did that for each other.

27:34.190 --> 27:36.412
We became a support group.

27:36.432 --> 27:38.053
And then that developed into...

27:38.472 --> 27:49.347
you know, vamos a poner bailes, vamos a, you know, little skits, little things, having some visibility with the student union.

27:49.367 --> 27:52.531
You know, we weren't involved in the ASB.

27:52.551 --> 27:53.613
We wanted to have a voice.

27:53.833 --> 28:02.805
We wanted, we didn't, we didn't, I mean, we were there by the, by the straps of the boots or what do you call them?

28:03.166 --> 28:03.947
Bootstraps?

28:04.227 --> 28:07.011
But yeah, you know, we were there because we had,

28:07.666 --> 28:08.447
Oh.

28:08.467 --> 28:10.130
Because we had, I mean, we were there.

28:10.450 --> 28:20.926
The fact that we were there, you know, most of us, my mom was, at the time, my mom was probably working, cutting chavacanos, and probably waitressing, and, you know.

28:21.166 --> 28:28.297
Do you mean, like, you guys, whoever was there at that time was there because of their... Not on scholarships.

28:28.317 --> 28:32.884
Yeah, because of, like, their individual talents, or is that what you mean?

28:33.245 --> 28:33.906
Or ganas.

28:34.046 --> 28:34.146
Yeah.

28:34.345 --> 28:36.607
We were there because we had ganas.

28:36.627 --> 28:40.952
Yeah, not because somebody pushed you or guided you towards it.

28:41.072 --> 28:47.698
Well, this nice teacher was, you know, I'll never, I wish I were in touch with her.

28:48.760 --> 28:51.622
The one from the education, or the employment office.

28:51.642 --> 28:53.745
The one from the clerk typist program.

28:53.765 --> 28:55.126
Yeah.

28:55.146 --> 29:03.154
And, but we were there because we had the, we had the gaspa, we had the,

29:03.353 --> 29:07.257
the coraje, we had the ganas.

29:08.639 --> 29:25.378
We knew who we were, you know, no matter what stuff was going on around us or what the high school counselor said to us or what the community said to us, we wanted to study.

29:26.619 --> 29:31.205
And we wanted, for me, I wanted to study and I wanted to go back to the high school.

29:31.225 --> 29:33.327
I wanted to be a high school counselor.

29:33.695 --> 29:35.943
and do it differently.

29:35.963 --> 29:41.865
So from the very beginning, that was my, I never became a high school counselor, but

29:42.014 --> 29:46.781
And was that because of the experience you had with your high school counseling?

29:46.801 --> 29:47.102
Yeah.

29:47.122 --> 29:57.878
And just because, you know, my, my grandpa, I spent a lot of time with my grandpa cause my mom, you know, was always working and I, um, I always had a, I was always outspoken.

29:57.898 --> 30:03.967
So my mom used to take me down to stay with grandpa for awhile.

30:05.549 --> 30:06.771
He lived four blocks away.

30:06.851 --> 30:09.996
So I spent a lot of time with grandpa and, um,

30:11.056 --> 30:23.374
So we were, I was always interested and my mom was always encouraging us that, you know, we were going to need to be able to fend for ourselves.

30:23.394 --> 30:29.443
The more educated, formally educated we were, the better opportunities we would have.

30:29.503 --> 30:40.219
So even though she, as an important backbone, part of my backbone is my mom, of course.

30:40.857 --> 30:45.105
And she finished San Jose City College, and she went to San Jose State.

30:45.506 --> 30:49.374
She was about two or three classes shy of graduating from San Jose State.

30:49.394 --> 30:54.564
After we were all done with ours, she took herself back to school.

30:54.584 --> 30:54.925
Wow.

30:55.225 --> 30:56.087
Yeah.

30:56.127 --> 30:58.131
She was a pretty amazing woman.

30:58.151 --> 30:58.793
I like it.

30:59.113 --> 31:00.416
Yeah.

31:00.576 --> 31:01.077
Excuse me.

31:02.170 --> 31:15.874
when you're talking about this campus activism at San Jose State, it's a lot of this, like, would you say, because I know Luis Valdez was not there when you were there.

31:18.018 --> 31:26.473
But when I talked to him as part of this oral history, he had mentioned that

31:26.723 --> 31:52.478
he was um that he was kind of like starting a whole bunch of stuff there probably like in 1963 around that time period a little bit earlier yeah so maybe about three or four years before um you were there and i'm wondering if were you aware of or

31:53.200 --> 32:18.043
knowledgeable that any of this had to do with kind of the work and stuff that he had was doing while he was there like did you see any kind of connection i think so because you just reminded me part of that group that was older than me a little bit only you know i mean to me i was a little kid you know fresh out of high school right and uh

32:18.935 --> 32:23.663
And these were, you know, I mean, I looked up to these people that had been there a few years.

32:24.044 --> 32:27.290
And some of them were already married and had families.

32:27.610 --> 32:31.317
But there was a guy, Adrian, your dad will know his last name.

32:31.718 --> 32:32.759
He's a redhead.

32:32.779 --> 32:33.360
Vargas.

32:33.761 --> 32:35.785
Adrian Vargas with Teatro de la Gente.

32:35.905 --> 32:36.145
Yeah.

32:36.927 --> 32:43.879
So, and so that kind of, that kind of makes some connections that I hadn't thought of for a long time.

32:44.078 --> 32:49.845
that there had been another wave prior to Adriana.

32:49.865 --> 32:51.367
Like a cohort before.

32:51.387 --> 32:52.789
Garza, Humberto Garza.

32:52.849 --> 32:53.710
Humberto Garza.

32:54.992 --> 32:55.953
There was Humberto Garza.

32:55.973 --> 32:57.575
Your dad probably knows the name.

32:58.256 --> 33:03.303
Humberto has written, Humberto Garza has written books or a book.

33:03.323 --> 33:06.186
You may want to, you know what?

33:06.427 --> 33:07.268
He's here.

33:07.388 --> 33:09.310
He's in Delano.

33:09.330 --> 33:10.051
He's in this area.

33:11.173 --> 33:12.955
Oh, he would be super interesting to,

33:13.205 --> 33:22.297
He's like Luis and then the group that Humberto hung out with.

33:22.338 --> 33:23.439
He's got it written.

33:24.220 --> 33:28.626
So you may want to, if nothing else, look for that.

33:29.127 --> 33:31.370
And then came the younger folks.

33:31.650 --> 33:32.852
I'm the younger folks, right?

33:32.952 --> 33:33.333
Yeah.

33:33.713 --> 33:35.796
But I ended up lucky.

33:36.477 --> 33:40.242
I was lucky to fall into the group because of my upper division.

33:41.217 --> 33:49.068
Spanish classes that took me to meet a lot of those people that were more involved.

33:49.448 --> 34:10.937
But the university was hopping with activism, not only anti-war, but there was a lot of , and so there were a lot of people into conservation and

34:11.677 --> 34:14.300
I don't know if your dad told you.

34:14.320 --> 34:16.843
I don't know if your dad was at San Jose State.

34:17.303 --> 34:19.065
No, he was at Fresno.

34:19.105 --> 34:20.927
My mom went to San Jose State.

34:21.288 --> 34:23.410
Maybe your dad knows Irma Castro.

34:23.790 --> 34:24.551
Maybe, yeah.

34:24.571 --> 34:26.754
I'll ask him when I get back there today.

34:27.034 --> 34:30.117
Yeah.

34:32.300 --> 34:36.064
The old student union is right on 7th Street.

34:37.005 --> 34:37.245
Yeah.

34:38.069 --> 34:40.152
There was an old... The building's still there.

34:40.412 --> 34:42.995
Yeah, and they remodeled it, like, completely.

34:43.296 --> 34:44.878
I don't know when the last time they've been there.

34:44.898 --> 34:46.660
No, you're talking about the new student union.

34:47.221 --> 34:55.252
Well, it was in the... It used to be the library... No, not the library, but kind of nearby the library, the Clark Library.

34:55.872 --> 34:57.134
Was that there when you were there?

34:57.935 --> 35:07.688
I might be thinking of... You're thinking of the student union that was several stories high.

35:08.090 --> 35:10.253
And it's a lot of cement and all that.

35:10.273 --> 35:11.134
Yeah.

35:11.575 --> 35:13.397
That was built when I was still there.

35:13.718 --> 35:14.118
Yeah.

35:14.138 --> 35:20.967
But prior to that, there was a small little building, probably twice the size of this house.

35:21.128 --> 35:24.813
That was the student union where we had the cafeteria.

35:24.833 --> 35:25.734
I think it's still there.

35:26.996 --> 35:32.904
But anyway, there's a lawn area between 7th Street sidewalk and the building.

35:32.924 --> 35:35.447
It was kind of set way back there.

35:35.680 --> 35:40.215
I wonder if you're talking about the alumni house or if that's different.

35:41.299 --> 35:43.044
It's not one of the old, old buildings.

35:44.890 --> 35:46.315
It's...

35:47.577 --> 35:54.305
Well, it's hard to tell now because they've done so much renovation.

35:54.385 --> 35:55.286
Did you go there?

35:55.687 --> 35:58.109
Yeah, I have three degrees from there.

35:59.531 --> 36:12.066
Well, you know, I don't know if the art department is on the other side of the street and then 7th Street going toward the old student union that I think you're thinking about.

36:12.367 --> 36:15.992
There's a little building that was a very modest little building.

36:16.192 --> 36:21.058
That was the cafeteria in the student union building.

36:21.078 --> 36:26.264
And in that lawn area, I don't know if we did this with permission.

36:26.465 --> 36:29.669
I would suspect we did it without permission.

36:29.689 --> 36:33.253
But they actually brought in a thing.

36:33.273 --> 36:36.757
We dug a hole and we buried a Volkswagen.

36:36.797 --> 36:38.740
Nobody has told you about that?

36:38.760 --> 36:39.341
No.

36:39.361 --> 36:41.243
I've never heard of that.

36:41.442 --> 36:47.068
Preserving the environment and the smog emissions were terrible.

36:47.509 --> 36:48.029
How funny.

36:48.550 --> 36:54.437
I wonder, considering all the remodeling and construction, if they found it.

36:55.538 --> 36:57.900
It's a, what do you call it?

36:58.141 --> 36:59.803
A time capsule.

36:59.943 --> 37:01.084
Like a time capsule?

37:01.945 --> 37:02.506
I don't know.

37:02.606 --> 37:04.848
I don't think we put anything in it.

37:04.868 --> 37:06.010
It was an old Volkswagen.

37:06.330 --> 37:08.993
It was a good Volkswagen.

37:09.594 --> 37:10.875
We were making a statement.

37:10.973 --> 37:12.374
Uh-huh.

37:12.394 --> 37:13.876
For the environment.

37:13.896 --> 37:18.841
So my point is that it was active in many areas for many reasons.

37:18.961 --> 37:20.502
Different causes and stuff like that.

37:20.522 --> 37:22.865
Yeah, we were at the same time.

37:22.885 --> 37:31.813
The other thing that was going on external to the university that was encouraging, I think, the movimiento was the huelga.

37:33.375 --> 37:35.117
Because a great boycott was going on.

37:35.177 --> 37:39.681
This is about probably my second, third year at San Jose State.

37:39.897 --> 37:47.364
So external to the university was the United Farm Workers' issues out in the community.

37:48.545 --> 37:51.868
So we were paving in safe ways.

37:54.651 --> 38:09.145
So there was a lot of things that were confluent that encouraged people to talk, to think, and to...

38:09.985 --> 38:17.695
they, you know, there was a lot of way to find a forum for a lot of critical conversations to happen.

38:17.955 --> 38:18.336
Yeah.

38:18.816 --> 38:38.642
So would you say, um, would you say that your, your introduction or involvement in all of these things was, was mostly, um,

38:39.618 --> 39:08.578
mostly motivated by your interaction with the campus or do you think there was something even before that or you know what was it that that made you join in with these groups what was it that i know you kind of talked about your you know that you guys were peer mentoring and helping each other out while you were at the university i think some of it is just the nature of a person because um

39:10.364 --> 39:15.012
I always liked language and I always expressed myself.

39:15.773 --> 39:27.732
I remember my grandpa seriously encouraging me to become a lawyer because he used to see that in me.

39:27.931 --> 39:32.338
And, you know, he's, of course, grandpa, grandpa age.

39:32.358 --> 39:33.600
He died in his 80s.

39:34.141 --> 39:40.812
So I met him when he was about probably 70, 60s, 70s.

39:41.593 --> 39:45.660
And so I had, I spent a lot of time with grandma and grandpa.

39:46.401 --> 39:50.327
And so conversations tend to be different with older folks.

39:50.307 --> 39:58.155
Yeah, and they never discouraged me from thinking and asking and talking.

39:58.295 --> 39:59.196
I talked a lot.

40:00.057 --> 40:13.911
As a matter of fact, my fifth grade teacher became so frustrated with me because I wouldn't be quiet.

40:13.931 --> 40:15.533
I always had questions.

40:16.013 --> 40:19.977
I do remember that in primaria.

40:20.851 --> 40:29.308
he actually taped my mouth and he had a peer walk me, parade me through the school as a punishment.

40:31.292 --> 40:34.438
So I think that some of the stuff of,

40:34.570 --> 40:44.742
You know, you've got a mind to think and you see, I mean, he used to make us kneel on little piedritas.

40:44.802 --> 40:47.285
I mean, this is the 50s, right?

40:48.466 --> 40:48.566
Yeah.

40:48.586 --> 40:58.738
So we didn't have any of that stuff in the secundaria, but in the primaria, some of the teachers were real old school.

40:59.073 --> 40:59.734
Abusive?

41:00.514 --> 41:02.416
Yeah.

41:02.637 --> 41:14.829
Never to the point where, you know, they were really not as bad as you hear, you know, some of the old timers tell you, but yeah, they were a little bit on the rough side.

41:15.289 --> 41:21.956
And this particular teacher used to make a kneel on little pebbles.

41:22.637 --> 41:23.117
It was bad.

41:23.137 --> 41:23.898
Oh, nice.

41:23.918 --> 41:27.462
Yeah, and for me, I remember that.

41:27.822 --> 41:28.843
That shaming was...

41:29.043 --> 41:33.785
Actually, you know, I remember that as his intention was to shame me.

41:34.548 --> 41:36.758
I think I wore it as a badge.

41:38.797 --> 41:42.261
So what you're saying is you've always been rebellious.

41:43.462 --> 41:43.562
Yeah.

41:43.582 --> 41:43.803
Yeah.

41:43.823 --> 41:57.778
That's why I spent a lot of time with my grandparents because my mom was struggling, you know, for kids and, and she didn't need this mouthy kid, this nonconformist woman that was always challenging.

41:57.798 --> 42:00.962
I mean, I'm, I'm the one that, that stayed with her the longest.

42:00.982 --> 42:02.964
I, I left when I got married.

42:02.984 --> 42:06.147
I mean, the day that I got married is the day I left home.

42:06.167 --> 42:08.550
I stayed with her, you know, but,

42:09.020 --> 42:11.984
And we were really good friends, really good friends.

42:12.104 --> 42:17.351
But we were probably very much this similar, you know.

42:17.371 --> 42:17.792
Yeah.

42:18.273 --> 42:22.779
That, you know, sometimes that creates friction.

42:22.799 --> 42:23.960
I call it constructive.

42:25.022 --> 42:25.602
What is it?

42:27.064 --> 42:28.066
What is it that I call it?

42:30.870 --> 42:32.151
It's constructive tension.

42:33.013 --> 42:34.915
Yeah, I think so.

42:35.196 --> 42:36.978
I think, I don't know.

42:37.318 --> 42:38.520
I think I, um,

42:39.327 --> 42:44.214
There's another phrase, if it comes back, I'll share it with you.

42:44.234 --> 42:46.777
Well, there's constructive criticism.

42:46.897 --> 42:49.240
No, this is constructive tension.

42:49.661 --> 42:50.041
Okay.

42:50.702 --> 42:58.032
Yeah, the stuff that was going on at San Jose State and out in the community and in your head was constructive tension.

42:58.272 --> 43:07.545
I mean, there was, you know, people had to work to get their, to buy their books and pay their tuition.

43:08.386 --> 43:09.267
You know, they had to,

43:10.141 --> 43:11.984
They had to pass their classes.

43:12.224 --> 43:13.987
I mean, we were struggling academically.

43:14.007 --> 43:16.030
We were struggling financially.

43:17.132 --> 43:24.343
I remember, your dad's going to laugh if you tell him this, but I remember, you can tell him this if you want.

43:24.363 --> 43:33.537
I remember having 37 cents enough in my pocket to buy one gallon of gas.

43:34.058 --> 43:34.258
Uh-huh.

43:35.639 --> 43:38.723
to take me from the east side to San Jose State for a couple of days.

43:39.043 --> 43:41.686
I remember that 37 cents for that one gallon.

43:41.966 --> 43:44.809
That was down to 37 cents.

43:45.731 --> 43:57.184
But I think all of that, the kind of intuitive sense that you have of yourself, of your abilities, you know better.

43:58.986 --> 44:05.393
You know better than the system trying to tell you that you're not going to do something.

44:05.744 --> 44:16.482
and your intuition of, you know, no, no, no, no.

44:16.662 --> 44:18.525
Don't tell me I can't do that.

44:20.007 --> 44:22.972
So my grandpa always encouraged me to speak.

44:24.014 --> 44:24.675
I remember that.

44:24.715 --> 44:25.977
That's part of my foundation.

44:27.360 --> 44:32.248
So my mom was having a real hard time with it, right?

44:32.268 --> 44:32.528
Right.

44:32.812 --> 44:40.861
But now that I'm old and I understand her, I understood this a long time ago, you know, she was struggling.

44:41.281 --> 44:49.591
She didn't need on top of everything that she had to survive to have to deal with me.

44:49.611 --> 44:52.374
And she luckily had the support system.

44:52.494 --> 44:54.416
My grandpa's right down the street.

44:54.796 --> 44:57.159
And so I spent quite a bit of time with him.

44:57.199 --> 44:59.882
And a lot of my formation, a lot of my

45:00.301 --> 45:03.625
So at home, I was more restricted from all of that.

45:03.986 --> 45:09.813
At my grandparents' house, I was really encouraged to have a mind of my own.

45:10.334 --> 45:13.278
That's good.

45:13.518 --> 45:26.595
Okay, so we've been talking about your experience and time at San Jose State University, the campus activism, and... The community activism, too.

45:27.014 --> 45:27.735
Oh, okay.

45:27.895 --> 45:29.757
So community and campus.

45:29.777 --> 45:30.398
The UFW.

45:30.458 --> 45:31.520
Right, right, right.

45:31.700 --> 45:33.642
Great influence in my life.

45:34.904 --> 45:48.401
And... So you ended up kind of, even though you didn't plan on it, you ended up going to the environmental activity and you saw the same people.

45:48.841 --> 45:53.807
And you went to the Chicano group and you saw the same people.

45:54.248 --> 45:55.249
You went to the war...

45:55.837 --> 46:03.104
rallies and you saw the same people so we became a support system to each other.

46:03.645 --> 46:24.105
So in terms of the Chicano movement in particular was most of your participation like campus or like education community type of involvement or did you see yourself as a participant in another way?

46:24.524 --> 46:36.334
Yeah, I think it was the core of it was our support system to help each other to get through, to pass classes and to eventually graduate.

46:37.495 --> 46:43.541
So there was a little bit of, not a little bit, a lot of machismo stuff going on in that group.

46:44.322 --> 46:46.303
Has anyone brought this up?

46:48.005 --> 46:50.687
For that particular group at San Jose State?

46:50.947 --> 46:51.408
No.

46:51.428 --> 46:53.890
But a lot of it is because...

46:54.494 --> 47:01.722
The people that I've been interviewing, most of them are from the valley or they didn't go to San Jose State.

47:01.842 --> 47:13.475
The only person, the only two people, well, three people now, including yourself, that have any kind of connection to San Jose State is Luis and my mom.

47:14.997 --> 47:18.661
So I'm not getting a clue.

47:18.681 --> 47:21.825
Yeah, the guys were talking us into typing their papers.

47:22.005 --> 47:22.105
Yeah.

47:22.304 --> 47:23.926
And things like that.

47:24.267 --> 47:26.029
And I did that for a while.

47:26.810 --> 47:30.154
Probably the better part of a year.

47:30.274 --> 47:35.481
And then it... Wait a minute.

47:35.501 --> 47:40.087
So there was some of... I've always thought of it as machismo.

47:40.828 --> 47:47.156
And we probably brought good food to the gatherings and things like that.

47:47.817 --> 47:50.961
But I remember it being an issue for me.

47:51.565 --> 47:53.908
And something that I addressed.

47:54.548 --> 47:55.389
And that's all it took.

47:55.750 --> 47:57.712
You just address it and then it stopped.

47:58.173 --> 47:58.533
Really?

47:59.014 --> 47:59.814
Yeah.

47:59.834 --> 48:00.195
Oh, yeah.

48:00.916 --> 48:01.456
Are you kidding?

48:01.536 --> 48:14.311
I think, well, I think a lot of the narratives, especially the ones that like I hear, not hear about from the actual people that were there, but historians who are doing the work today.

48:15.693 --> 48:16.113
That was an issue.

48:16.133 --> 48:20.458
You hear a lot of like, oh, there was machismo here, there was machismo there.

48:20.793 --> 48:28.222
And then, and it always kind of comes off like nobody wanted to do anything about it.

48:28.242 --> 48:35.671
But it sounds like kind of what you're saying is people were aware, they said stop it, and it stopped.

48:36.292 --> 48:38.154
Yeah, yeah.

48:38.235 --> 48:43.481
But it took a while to, this doesn't feel right.

48:44.783 --> 48:45.944
What is it?

48:45.964 --> 48:46.945
And then addressing it.

48:47.126 --> 48:47.526
Mm-hmm.

48:47.995 --> 48:53.140
And, um, but I do remember, and, and, you know, to some extent it's okay.

48:53.601 --> 49:02.870
To some extent, um, I think I do it even today, you know, things got organized and they got done.

49:04.031 --> 49:08.195
You know, the guys talked a lot and did a lot of the planning.

49:09.376 --> 49:15.522
Um, but the women did a lot of the work to make it actually come to fruition.

49:15.805 --> 49:16.306
Yeah.

49:16.326 --> 49:24.434
Did the phone calling and did the follow up and did the note taking and, and, you know, uh, and it became okay.

49:26.436 --> 49:41.312
Uh, as long as, you know, once it was addressed and then there was more sharing and then, you know, more people across the, the gender lines did the same kind of work, then it was okay.

49:41.332 --> 49:41.712
Yeah.

49:42.113 --> 50:00.491
I'm curious, I mean, since we're talking about that subject right now, I'm curious about whether or not it was, like, did it start that way because there just weren't a lot of women who wanted to be vocal?

50:00.551 --> 50:10.180
Like, it sounds like somebody like you, right, who's very expressive, who's very vocal, who is not afraid to speak their mind...

50:10.480 --> 50:17.348
Like, why would they not tap into you and say, Hey, Aurora, like, why don't you be our speaker for this?

50:18.129 --> 50:28.722
Was it just, was it that, or was it that, you know, a lot of the, the women were not saying, you know, like, Hey, I want to, I want to talk about this.

50:29.984 --> 50:30.524
You know what I mean?

50:31.045 --> 50:39.475
Or am I, I don't think it was that the women didn't, but that it was more, some of these guys were,

50:40.501 --> 51:09.327
remember i mentioned they were married yeah family so they tended to be even older than you would expect they were fresh out of high school two three years down the road they were like five six seven years down the road they were bringing themselves back to school married and back to school so i think for some of them it was in their nature like nobody had interrupted it right so like like

51:09.863 --> 51:10.364
I don't know.

51:10.444 --> 51:13.508
They just had kind of like a traditional type of mindset.

51:13.528 --> 51:14.870
Yes, yes, yes, yes.

51:14.890 --> 51:15.030
Yeah.

51:15.491 --> 51:15.812
Okay.

51:15.832 --> 51:37.763
They weren't that much older than, than, uh, than I was, but they were old enough that they, that it was more, you know, but, but, you know, once you address it and if there's, if everybody's collaborating and everybody has, um, everybody's respected, I mean, all of those things.

51:38.044 --> 51:38.284
Right.

51:38.382 --> 51:47.834
You know, when it wasn't feeling, um, fair or just, I mean, those were the issues that we were dealing with.

51:47.854 --> 51:48.636
Yeah.

51:48.656 --> 51:54.083
So that was one of the issues that, that we had to address.

51:54.103 --> 51:55.364
Very interesting.

51:55.925 --> 51:58.168
So, uh, and it didn't stop, of course.

51:58.589 --> 51:59.189
No.

51:59.209 --> 52:05.838
I mean, it, it went into once we got the jobs and we all became teachers, the guys were treated differently.

52:05.858 --> 52:08.001
As a matter of fact, um,

52:09.382 --> 52:35.372
I ended up getting transferred out of San Jose High School to Lincoln High School because a guy with a family, a guy that was one year junior, not age-wise, but in terms of longevity, he got the permanent offer at San Jose High.

52:35.875 --> 52:45.629
And I was transferred into another probationary or temporary position that somebody was out on a leave at Lincoln High.

52:46.069 --> 52:46.209
Why?

52:46.650 --> 52:48.893
Because the guy was married and he had a family.

52:49.093 --> 52:49.875
Right.

52:49.895 --> 52:51.877
And he needed a job.

52:51.897 --> 52:53.800
So you're talking about that...

52:53.780 --> 53:21.070
uh like in general as a structure of like a patriarchal structure yes yes yes right not necessarily like oh these same chicano activists were still doing this and they're the ones no it's just that you know your environment i mean it it never it never really it never really fully changes fully you know yeah no i hear you you probably are dealing with

53:21.809 --> 53:25.392
with issues even, you know, in your generation.

53:25.412 --> 53:26.554
Yes, I have.

53:26.934 --> 53:27.254
Yeah.

53:28.235 --> 53:29.556
So it never ends.

53:29.737 --> 53:38.545
But those are... But it was a good environment, you know, for that creative tension.

53:39.506 --> 53:40.767
Yeah, interesting.

53:40.847 --> 53:45.352
In different ways, in different areas, including your relationship within your own group.

53:45.612 --> 53:46.353
Uh-huh.

53:48.114 --> 53:51.057
And so would you say that that was...

53:51.425 --> 54:02.696
the education factor, whether it's at San Jose state university or, you know, where you moved on after you were, you were done at San Jose state or graduated.

54:03.597 --> 54:08.842
Um, was that the extent of your involvement with the Chicano movement?

54:08.862 --> 54:10.824
Oh no, no.

54:10.844 --> 54:19.693
Um, it became a high school teacher and, uh, the person who hired me, um,

54:21.142 --> 54:28.994
innovated a program that, you know, a lot of people structurally have in place nowadays.

54:29.454 --> 54:37.447
But what he did is he took a hundred juniors and seniors or so, a hundred, 120 of them that were struggling.

54:37.807 --> 54:42.674
They were very capable young people that were, you know, sweat hogs.

54:43.095 --> 54:44.317
You know, you know, sweat hogs?

54:44.337 --> 54:46.440
No.

54:49.829 --> 54:52.372
It's an old movie.

54:52.392 --> 54:53.754
You know, Travolta?

54:54.275 --> 54:55.076
John Travolta.

54:55.556 --> 54:57.779
John Travolta and the Sweat Hogs.

54:59.401 --> 54:59.461
No.

54:59.481 --> 55:02.485
Anyway, they're very, well, you know, Stand and Deliver.

55:03.066 --> 55:03.486
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

55:03.506 --> 55:10.735
You know, the Sweat Hogs, they're very capable that go and ace the AP calculus.

55:10.755 --> 55:11.056
Uh-huh.

55:11.156 --> 55:16.302
They're very capable, but they're not encouraged.

55:16.322 --> 55:16.503
Right.

55:16.783 --> 55:16.883
Yeah.

55:17.285 --> 55:20.310
So we had these 120 kids.

55:20.470 --> 55:26.900
There were six teachers, two English, two math, two social studies teachers.

55:27.301 --> 55:31.668
And we had a non-traditional urban studies program.

55:32.930 --> 55:34.192
And this is high school?

55:34.272 --> 55:35.254
San Jose High.

55:35.274 --> 55:36.115
Oh, San Jose High.

55:36.375 --> 55:39.921
So the guy to hire me hired me into that kind of structure.

55:40.141 --> 55:42.465
And that was...

55:45.112 --> 56:01.752
The environment that I gravitated toward and also people kind of spotted me like the clerk typist teacher, Latina, you know, she spotted me, she brought me the app, you know, then I took it from there.

56:01.852 --> 56:10.582
The same thing with the high school principal went to San Jose State and recruited people that he spotted.

56:11.504 --> 56:13.566
And we went through the credential program.

56:14.440 --> 56:18.324
master's in credential program at Stanford, thank God.

56:19.865 --> 56:32.918
So there are advocates along the way that you play a role that open doors, that open possibilities.

56:33.319 --> 56:36.462
And so that happened.

56:37.943 --> 56:39.705
That led to

56:40.327 --> 57:03.287
he'd been doing it for two or three years, so he had a little core of Chicano teachers that continued to provide that support, that continued to place that creative environment where people can think and talk and create together.

57:03.928 --> 57:04.950
So there was a group

57:05.167 --> 57:10.716
There was actually, in those days, San Jose Unified had two unions.

57:11.558 --> 57:20.993
The AFT, which has the reputation of being a more militant group, was the high school teachers were AFT.

57:21.013 --> 57:27.023
The elementary teachers were CTA, and they had the

57:27.391 --> 57:34.500
tradition of being less militant than AFT, supposedly.

57:34.520 --> 57:37.645
So the high school teachers started a Chicano Teachers Association.

57:38.185 --> 57:39.147
And you were part of that?

57:39.367 --> 57:40.088
Yes.

57:40.108 --> 57:40.268
Oh, wow.

57:40.408 --> 57:40.629
Yes.

57:41.309 --> 57:46.456
But I may not have been if I had chosen to go into the elementary.

57:46.476 --> 57:46.777
Right.

57:47.077 --> 57:51.683
And I had chosen to go into a different environment.

57:52.224 --> 57:52.364
Uh-huh.

57:52.484 --> 57:53.145
You know what I'm saying?

57:53.866 --> 57:53.966
Yeah.

57:53.986 --> 57:56.149
Eventually, the entire...

57:56.433 --> 58:04.140
district became CTA and there's nothing non-activist about CTA.

58:04.160 --> 58:18.312
CTA is pretty active union, but in those days, the Chicano teachers organization became a part of the AFT.

58:20.534 --> 58:24.938
And so the AFT meetings and so on and so forth, there were groups that were

58:25.087 --> 58:34.042
you know, within the, the teachers association that claimed and reclaimed, you know, their, their own voice.

58:34.062 --> 58:37.007
And they had, they had a presence in the union.

58:37.127 --> 58:38.790
You know what I mean?

58:38.810 --> 58:41.154
And that was CTA?

58:41.375 --> 58:41.775
CTO.

58:41.795 --> 58:42.637
Oh, CTO.

58:42.797 --> 58:44.039
Organization.

58:44.199 --> 58:44.580
CTO.

58:45.050 --> 59:14.820
um your dad might be aware oh no because he was from prison okay so what was um so this is your involvement with the cto is going to be after your the work you did and and the stuff you were doing at san jose state correct correct and then um what just out of curiosity what were you kind of mentioned that that program at san jose high

59:15.425 --> 59:18.052
right, with the sweat hogs.

59:19.316 --> 59:22.164
I'm sorry to call them this.

59:22.184 --> 59:28.742
You know, I say it admiringly because they were very bright, very bright kids that were, you know,

59:29.650 --> 59:33.315
No, yeah, I understand what you're saying.

59:33.675 --> 59:35.538
But we were very successful.

59:35.919 --> 59:43.429
Yeah, so would that have been a program that was organized by that group, the CTO?

59:44.691 --> 59:57.548
Yes, in part, but not exclusively, because Pete, who was the principal, recruited people who were very creative people.

59:58.270 --> 01:00:00.733
and they were of different backgrounds.

01:00:01.514 --> 01:00:10.224
But there were, I would say maybe, I wouldn't say, I know, I think four out of the six teachers were Chicanos.

01:00:11.425 --> 01:00:19.675
But there was more, there were a couple more, two or three more that were in the mainstream program that were part of the Chicano teachers group.

01:00:20.236 --> 01:00:24.701
So what was the Chicano teachers organization?

01:00:25.542 --> 01:00:27.484
Was that just kind of a...

01:00:28.375 --> 01:00:32.140
Like, hey, we have our own kind of caucus within this larger.

01:00:32.160 --> 01:00:33.502
It was a caucus within the union.

01:00:33.522 --> 01:00:33.862
Right.

01:00:33.882 --> 01:00:34.243
Yes.

01:00:34.263 --> 01:00:38.108
So within the teachers union, California Teachers Association, is that what you're called?

01:00:38.128 --> 01:00:40.171
No, American Federation of Teachers.

01:00:40.191 --> 01:00:40.651
Oh.

01:00:40.792 --> 01:00:41.152
AFT.

01:00:42.854 --> 01:00:53.168
You don't hear about AFT that much, but it's a very, as a matter of fact, at the national level, you hear about AFT more so.

01:00:55.223 --> 01:01:03.395
AFT is, you know, CTA kind of took over in California, California Teachers Association, right?

01:01:05.158 --> 01:01:19.158
AFT was a national union that was active in California, but little by little, I would guess that there aren't very many AFT chapters, AFT units in California anymore.

01:01:19.619 --> 01:01:20.961
I think it's pretty much CTA.

01:01:21.548 --> 01:01:35.705
But as an example, we used to take kids out into the community as part of their, you know, an extension of their classroom.

01:01:36.105 --> 01:01:43.855
Some of our work was, some of our classroom time was spent at Angela Davis trial downtown.

01:01:45.517 --> 01:01:47.539
And so it was that kind of group.

01:01:47.840 --> 01:01:48.921
Mm-hmm.

01:01:48.941 --> 01:01:57.390
Not only Chicano teachers, but it was a group of teachers who were very progressive and very... So maybe interested in, like, social justice?

01:01:58.251 --> 01:01:58.391
Mm-hmm.

01:01:58.411 --> 01:01:58.712
Oh, yeah.

01:01:59.172 --> 01:01:59.332
Okay.

01:01:59.352 --> 01:02:00.594
Yeah.

01:02:00.614 --> 01:02:04.658
And so I taught at San Jose High.

01:02:04.738 --> 01:02:06.520
I taught urban studies primarily.

01:02:07.261 --> 01:02:15.109
When Pete left, when that transitioned and then moved over to Lincoln High School, I ended up teaching.

01:02:15.209 --> 01:02:15.990
I was teaching...

01:02:16.527 --> 01:02:20.013
foreign language, urban studies, and Pete left.

01:02:20.975 --> 01:02:24.782
And then that next year, they moved me over to teach foreign language.

01:02:26.044 --> 01:02:31.354
And so I taught ESL and Spanish.

01:02:31.374 --> 01:02:39.008
And in the English department, I started a Chicano literature class at San Jose High.

01:02:39.308 --> 01:02:45.467
developed the curriculum and put it together, got it approved, got it through the district, the whole thing.

01:02:45.948 --> 01:02:48.897
And of course, when the younger guy

01:02:49.163 --> 01:03:18.343
with a family got hired into the permanent position and I got shifted over because I was young and unmarried right so the program didn't continue it was picked up later but it didn't continue yeah that was a real that was a real blow to me I have a friend who works right now at Pioneer High School teaching Chicano literature oh yeah it took years to recuperate yeah

01:03:18.880 --> 01:03:20.002
Yeah.

01:03:20.142 --> 01:03:31.619
But it teaches you the lesson that if a program or a thing or an activity depends on you, then he didn't finish the job.

01:03:31.999 --> 01:03:32.680
Right.

01:03:32.781 --> 01:03:34.623
It should not depend on you.

01:03:34.643 --> 01:03:35.284
Right.

01:03:35.304 --> 01:03:36.426
It should continue on.

01:03:36.446 --> 01:03:37.467
The principal left.

01:03:37.507 --> 01:03:38.629
He's the one that did.

01:03:38.849 --> 01:03:40.171
He was very intuitive.

01:03:40.211 --> 01:03:48.043
He gave us what we call in Spanish, rienda suelta, when you let go of the reins of the course.

01:03:48.209 --> 01:03:49.330
He just let him gallop.

01:03:50.131 --> 01:03:53.615
He gave us a lot of galloping slack, right?

01:03:53.656 --> 01:03:58.882
But when he left, it hadn't been a structural change in the school.

01:03:58.962 --> 01:03:59.502
You know what I mean?

01:03:59.763 --> 01:04:00.243
Yeah.

01:04:00.303 --> 01:04:03.527
So that I could continue well if he wasn't there.

01:04:04.168 --> 01:04:15.401
An important thing that I thought of with the Chicano teachers, Chicano teachers organization, what's it, CTO, CTA, CTO, it's CTO, it's organization.

01:04:17.023 --> 01:04:17.524
We...

01:04:18.398 --> 01:04:32.972
concurrent to what we were kind of defining some of the work that needed to be done because, you know, I mean, we didn't have a blueprint or anything like that.

01:04:32.992 --> 01:04:33.112
Right.

01:04:33.412 --> 01:04:37.175
Kind of thinking about it and developing it as we went along.

01:04:37.776 --> 01:04:37.876
Yeah.

01:04:37.896 --> 01:04:47.545
There was also a very significant court case that plaintiffs in the San Jose High School area

01:04:47.913 --> 01:04:53.438
had brought against San Jose Unified for unequal treatment.

01:04:53.458 --> 01:05:05.751
And so if you went to San Jose High and you, and this, that had just preceded the time when some of us, when Pete started bringing us in, the court, the lawsuit had just preceded that.

01:05:05.771 --> 01:05:14.359
And for example, the science facilities, the science equipment, the PE equipment, the PE activities,

01:05:14.710 --> 01:05:22.918
The classroom tools were significantly different for Pioneer and San Jose High.

01:05:22.938 --> 01:05:26.162
At the time, Pioneer was not integrated.

01:05:26.282 --> 01:05:32.588
You know, Pioneer and Leland and Willow Glen, of course, super.

01:05:33.129 --> 01:05:35.932
So this was before desegregation.

01:05:35.952 --> 01:05:44.160
So the lawsuit had brought in that dimension into the conversation.

01:05:44.309 --> 01:06:06.975
And so what we did, you know, the teacher was not supporting us, but we were picketing at the district office and outside of San Jose High School after work hours because the union wasn't supporting us in support of the efforts of the plaintiffs, right?

01:06:07.597 --> 01:06:20.320
for different curriculum, for support systems, for the different programs that we saw the kids not getting at San Jose High and in other schools.

01:06:20.341 --> 01:06:27.494
And so the union didn't take it seriously enough to confront the district about it.

01:06:28.616 --> 01:06:31.461
So the Chicano Teachers Organization

01:06:32.217 --> 01:06:59.119
did make it visible kind of on our own the caucus only right you know we were um years later when i went to the district office i i ended up being an administrator uh-huh i used to tease the older guys that were there and i told them you know i saw you taking my picture when i was out there picketing when you you know i'd really like to keep

01:06:59.605 --> 01:07:01.748
Those pictures for my albums.

01:07:01.768 --> 01:07:02.850
Come on, give me my pictures.

01:07:03.390 --> 01:07:12.062
But, you know, the district was pretty upset about the fact that the AFT had a Chicano caucus.

01:07:12.984 --> 01:07:17.189
But later, the same thing happened with CTA.

01:07:17.470 --> 01:07:19.453
So the whole district became CTA, right?

01:07:20.414 --> 01:07:24.640
And within the CTA, there was a bilingual teacher caucus.

01:07:25.381 --> 01:07:28.465
If I'm not mistaken, it might have been the first...

01:07:28.883 --> 01:07:41.195
I mean, I probably should research it, but at least that's what we thought, that it was the first official bilingual teacher caucus in the state of California at San Jose Unified.

01:07:42.256 --> 01:07:44.878
And so the activism, if you will.

01:07:45.579 --> 01:07:51.344
So my environment was always, you know, in answer to your question, that it continued in bilingual ed.

01:07:52.405 --> 01:07:58.671
It was not the DSEC court case because that got ruled,

01:07:59.326 --> 01:08:24.152
in favor of the district right i i moved i became more involved in bilingual ed because at my new school uh there were i was one of two teachers at lingon high school that that could speak spanish so i taught not only esl i taught math i taught algebra i taught uh state requirements i you know i had like

01:08:24.453 --> 01:08:39.193
five different preps because the kids were being sent home with a three-period day, four-period day because they couldn't learn math.

01:08:39.213 --> 01:08:40.555
They couldn't learn social studies.

01:08:40.575 --> 01:08:45.461
They were being excused from taking state requirements.

01:08:45.481 --> 01:08:46.202
Can you believe this?

01:08:47.023 --> 01:08:51.169
And so little rookie over here,

01:08:52.263 --> 01:08:59.854
I volunteered to teach all this stuff so the kids could have a full schedule and so they could have graduation requirements met, right?

01:08:59.974 --> 01:09:07.745
Because these kids were not going to be graduating if they didn't have state requirements, if they didn't pass a certain number of math classes.

01:09:08.507 --> 01:09:09.308
You know what I'm saying?

01:09:09.328 --> 01:09:09.648
Yeah.

01:09:09.728 --> 01:09:14.155
And so a couple of us went out of our ways intuitively, you know.

01:09:14.235 --> 01:09:14.355
Right.

01:09:14.740 --> 01:09:19.187
But the system has a way of taking advantage.

01:09:19.267 --> 01:09:20.589
What time period is this?

01:09:20.750 --> 01:09:21.671
Like the 70s, 80s?

01:09:21.691 --> 01:09:22.913
This is in the early 70s.

01:09:23.294 --> 01:09:23.654
Yeah.

01:09:23.674 --> 01:09:24.696
In the early 70s.

01:09:25.177 --> 01:09:32.208
Yeah, it's insane to think like, you know, you could hire more teachers.

01:09:32.228 --> 01:09:36.335
And it's just not a thought to them, you know?

01:09:36.575 --> 01:09:41.203
I was in that temporary role, temporary teacher role for years.

01:09:41.323 --> 01:09:41.423
Yeah.

01:09:41.757 --> 01:09:50.790
Both years that I was two or three years at San Jose High, and then the rest of my time, most of the rest of my time at Lincoln High, I was in a temporary spot.

01:09:50.810 --> 01:09:52.512
You know what that means?

01:09:52.532 --> 01:09:54.194
You don't have any kind of tenure.

01:09:54.234 --> 01:09:56.778
So they hire you, right?

01:09:56.798 --> 01:10:04.990
But they hire you into a slot that somebody is out having a baby or somebody is out sick or whatever.

01:10:05.430 --> 01:10:11.038
And so they can manipulate the system into hiring you as a temporary teacher.

01:10:11.474 --> 01:10:26.233
So that at the end of the year, the position goes away, the lady comes back from maternity leave or the guy comes back from whatever, and they can just give you your marching orders.

01:10:26.613 --> 01:10:34.343
I mean, eventually the things in the unions have changed so that they can't do that to you indefinitely anymore.

01:10:34.610 --> 01:10:38.174
You know, they have a probationary one, probationary two, and you got it.

01:10:38.494 --> 01:10:38.914
Right.

01:10:39.094 --> 01:10:39.495
Right.

01:10:39.515 --> 01:10:41.437
That's not the way it was in the seven days.

01:10:41.457 --> 01:10:45.020
They could keep you.

01:10:45.040 --> 01:11:01.917
And so my, my, my, my interest academically and what I taught took me into a different level of, of, uh, activism, you know, and language and social, social justice.

01:11:02.437 --> 01:11:04.300
through language and culture.

01:11:04.640 --> 01:11:13.272
And so my whole career then took a little bit of a different... So I was very involved in bilingual ed.

01:11:13.993 --> 01:11:14.734
All right.

01:11:16.296 --> 01:11:18.299
Well, that's all good to know here.

01:11:19.761 --> 01:11:24.748
Let me go ahead and switch over to my other main question.

01:11:24.897 --> 01:11:28.326
And that's about the concept of mestizaje.

01:11:28.346 --> 01:11:29.850
Are you familiar with that?

01:11:31.274 --> 01:11:35.245
Mestizaje, maybe you're more familiar with the term mestizo.

01:11:36.558 --> 01:11:39.241
No, go ahead and tell me some more.

01:11:40.943 --> 01:11:44.486
So, mestizo, mestizaje.

01:11:45.067 --> 01:11:50.152
Mestizo is typically the term that's used as an identity.

01:11:50.813 --> 01:11:54.597
We might say, oh, I'm a Chicano.

01:11:54.877 --> 01:11:56.759
Some people will say, I'm a mestizo.

01:11:57.020 --> 01:11:58.061
Or they say both, right?

01:11:58.121 --> 01:11:59.863
I'm a Chicano and I'm a mestizo.

01:12:00.984 --> 01:12:04.067
And typically when...

01:12:04.047 --> 01:12:27.186
somebody says they're mestizo they mean that they are half european and half indigenous indian right um and so i wanted to know if you had any if you're familiar with that concept or that identity and how you understand it um

01:12:28.347 --> 01:12:55.198
And it may be different, I mean... No, when I came to the States from Mexico, I think I was very... I think I had some very strong self-awareness that I think came from teachers at the elementary level.

01:12:55.533 --> 01:13:20.228
of my identity as the Mexicans that rejected colonialism, that understood the Mexican Revolution, that understood the Mexican independence prior to the revolution.

01:13:21.530 --> 01:13:24.274
So I think I had...

01:13:24.997 --> 01:13:47.950
quite a bit of... I remember two teachers in particular that spent a lot of time talking about that, you know, the meaning of non-subserviency and your...

01:13:49.263 --> 01:14:12.667
your rights, you know, to, to exist, um, without the influence of the, I, I was very bitter, uh, toward Europe and Spain and who, I, I, I've done my DNA more recently and I think it's more than just Spain.

01:14:13.148 --> 01:14:18.493
I should have my, my, um, my sense of, uh,

01:14:19.655 --> 01:14:47.164
resentment for the onslaught into my culture, thinking my culture, because I think it's more emotional, spiritual, my culture of my native roots in the continent, right?

01:14:47.482 --> 01:14:55.933
Because I think my, my, uh, DNA shows Portuguese and French and that kind of stuff.

01:14:55.953 --> 01:15:06.427
So it's, it's, um, different than when I, I always assumed it was mostly Spanish, but I always resented it.

01:15:06.447 --> 01:15:14.417
I always, um, but I think it had to do with how I was brought into understanding

01:15:14.937 --> 01:15:19.602
And you would attribute that to the education that you got in Mexico?

01:15:20.303 --> 01:15:20.903
Yes.

01:15:20.923 --> 01:15:25.368
Which was kind of a very, like you talked about colonialism, right?

01:15:25.388 --> 01:15:25.749
Right.

01:15:26.229 --> 01:15:44.809
And I don't think they discussed it that way, but I think it was probably discussions of pride, of authenticity, of si se puede, of

01:15:46.460 --> 01:15:58.474
of rejection of the subserviency that was imposed on the, you know, the people that were being oppressed in Mexico.

01:15:58.494 --> 01:16:02.499
So it was a lot of that kind of, so I remember those two teachers.

01:16:03.580 --> 01:16:09.367
Are you familiar with Jose Vasconcelos and the Raza Cosmica?

01:16:11.269 --> 01:16:14.813
Because he was probably, well, maybe earlier,

01:16:15.620 --> 01:16:20.706
Than when you would have been attending school, but he was the Secretary of Education.

01:16:20.766 --> 01:16:21.407
Right.

01:16:21.427 --> 01:16:22.007
Right?

01:16:22.027 --> 01:16:22.308
Right.

01:16:22.328 --> 01:16:27.013
So it's interesting to hear you talk about this.

01:16:27.033 --> 01:16:28.695
You know, I never thought of that.

01:16:29.095 --> 01:16:29.656
Uh-huh.

01:16:29.676 --> 01:16:31.098
That's very interesting.

01:16:31.538 --> 01:16:31.638
Yeah.

01:16:31.658 --> 01:16:41.189
Because I've really never spent any time understanding, you brought it up a couple of times, the public education system of the times.

01:16:42.230 --> 01:16:42.371
Mm-hmm.

01:16:42.391 --> 01:16:43.031
Yes.

01:16:43.292 --> 01:16:43.652
Yeah.

01:16:44.054 --> 01:16:47.317
Yeah, and so my teachers were prepared in that environment.

01:16:47.378 --> 01:16:48.399
Right.

01:16:49.820 --> 01:16:54.866
I'm looking at the Bolívar story on Netflix.

01:16:55.586 --> 01:17:00.191
I haven't seen it, but I want to watch it.

01:17:00.752 --> 01:17:06.758
For a very short couple of years of his life, his teacher opens his mind.

01:17:06.838 --> 01:17:08.280
That's all it took.

01:17:08.300 --> 01:17:08.740
Interesting.

01:17:08.760 --> 01:17:09.922
Just a teacher.

01:17:09.942 --> 01:17:10.282
Yeah.

01:17:10.743 --> 01:17:13.065
Just a teacher to respect him.

01:17:14.024 --> 01:17:28.222
And an environment where instead of this active little kid that was always getting into trouble, somebody didn't see him that way.

01:17:29.123 --> 01:17:29.383
Right?

01:17:29.564 --> 01:17:30.825
Somebody didn't see me that way.

01:17:32.668 --> 01:17:41.339
They saw me as somebody with a head, with a mind, with possibilities.

01:17:41.899 --> 01:17:42.220
Right.

01:17:42.240 --> 01:17:43.221
You know, with...

01:17:44.163 --> 01:17:46.565
I mean, it's different.

01:17:46.645 --> 01:17:48.447
So it's just interesting.

01:17:48.547 --> 01:17:50.408
I just started watching it.

01:17:50.428 --> 01:17:53.371
I'm about to check it out.

01:17:53.391 --> 01:17:58.055
Okay, so that is a very interesting tidbit there.

01:17:58.775 --> 01:18:04.740
It is because I think that you see it in a lot of the immigrants, right?

01:18:04.760 --> 01:18:05.080
Yeah.

01:18:05.101 --> 01:18:14.068
Where if you've had that kind of fertile environment

01:18:14.234 --> 01:18:33.870
fertile for your mind and for who you are and how confident you are in where you're from and how proud you are of your ancestral background.

01:18:34.792 --> 01:18:36.495
I remember having that.

01:18:37.218 --> 01:18:45.067
And I think all of that helped me to reject a lot of the stuff that I was experiencing here in the States.

01:18:45.968 --> 01:18:59.422
And so you see kids that come with literacy skills and with a sense of self and self-worth, nothing's going to stop them.

01:19:01.625 --> 01:19:06.330
Which is what we sought to do in bilingual ed.

01:19:07.019 --> 01:19:25.241
because a lot of the kids that were coming to us didn't necessarily, hadn't been in Mexico long enough or wherever they were from, Texas or wherever, to have been provided with a fertile place for their mind, you know, to blossom.

01:19:25.261 --> 01:19:33.010
And so in bilingual ed, through language and culture and community, we were seeking to do that, to create that fertile environment.

01:19:33.142 --> 01:19:45.765
On the topic of mestizaje, it sounds like this is something you're familiar with prior to coming to the US.

01:19:46.406 --> 01:19:47.007
I think so.

01:19:47.428 --> 01:19:51.555
I know so.

01:19:52.632 --> 01:20:11.332
But as you're becoming more involved with Chicano movement stuff, are you seeing this idea of mestizaje or mestizo identity as something that is, I don't know, like are these ideas that are floating around during that time period?

01:20:11.352 --> 01:20:15.176
Like when you're involved with the student groups at San Jose State?

01:20:18.780 --> 01:20:20.842
Yes, but I think that they were more intuitive.

01:20:21.703 --> 01:20:21.863
Mm-hmm.

01:20:22.484 --> 01:20:25.047
I don't know that we labeled them.

01:20:26.409 --> 01:20:27.911
We called ourselves Chicano.

01:20:29.794 --> 01:20:32.978
No, I think at San Jose State we didn't call ourselves a Chicano group.

01:20:33.018 --> 01:20:38.505
We called ourselves, it might have been at the Spanish club or something like that.

01:20:39.046 --> 01:20:40.869
Or like a La Raza.

01:20:41.209 --> 01:20:43.192
La Raza, yes.

01:20:44.293 --> 01:20:46.296
Yes, yes, yes, yes.

01:20:46.977 --> 01:20:49.420
That's what we called ourselves.

01:20:50.041 --> 01:20:51.003
And it made sense.

01:20:51.063 --> 01:20:52.586
It fit, you know, for me.

01:20:53.187 --> 01:21:10.260
There wasn't a lot of, um, I think for, for some of my peers, it was different because they, they had been born and raised, um, in the States, you know, they had, uh, they had, uh, they had more, um,

01:21:17.092 --> 01:21:28.849
I had been sheltered, I think, to some extent from some of the experiences that they had been through that had shaped them, had developed their chicanismo.

01:21:28.869 --> 01:21:39.165
For me, it was different because my chicanismo was a Mexican chicanismo, you know?

01:21:39.585 --> 01:21:46.896
It was chicanismo, but it was in a different environment.

01:21:47.635 --> 01:21:48.736
same issues.

01:21:49.597 --> 01:21:51.179
Yeah.

01:21:51.199 --> 01:22:03.532
The, you know, the, the class structures, the, the racial structures, the, the, the, the, um, opportunities issue.

01:22:04.613 --> 01:22:07.256
I mean, those, those things were all in Mexico.

01:22:07.496 --> 01:22:08.837
I mean, you know what I'm saying?

01:22:09.318 --> 01:22:09.698
Yeah.

01:22:10.179 --> 01:22:15.364
Um, well I think, and tell me if I'm wrong, but it seems like you're

01:22:16.373 --> 01:22:22.501
In the context of Mexico, I think what you're talking about is indigenismo.

01:22:22.521 --> 01:22:22.781
Yes.

01:22:23.362 --> 01:22:29.870
And then in the context of the United States, what's going on here is this chicanismo.

01:22:29.890 --> 01:22:30.451
Chicanismo, yeah.

01:22:30.471 --> 01:22:35.858
But they can almost be, like some of the things that they're experiencing, right?

01:22:35.878 --> 01:22:42.886
Whether you call yourself a Chicano or indigene, that you're dealing with some of these same issues.

01:22:43.127 --> 01:22:43.427
Right.

01:22:43.930 --> 01:22:48.757
And so that's very helpful.

01:22:48.837 --> 01:22:54.545
And it's not only indigenismo, it's also class issues.

01:22:55.006 --> 01:22:55.446
Yes.

01:22:55.466 --> 01:22:56.628
This is Mexico City.

01:22:56.788 --> 01:22:58.210
This is, you know.

01:22:58.951 --> 01:23:01.996
Yeah, and the same cabiza for chicanismo too, right?

01:23:02.176 --> 01:23:05.441
Yes, yes, yes, yes.

01:23:06.041 --> 01:23:09.246
But it was interesting that the...

01:23:11.588 --> 01:23:32.500
And my conscientization about all of that and my grasping of what I was bringing to the table and where I was going to take it next kind of took a twist between the two high schools.

01:23:32.648 --> 01:23:36.893
Because at the new high school, it really became bilingual ed.

01:23:36.913 --> 01:23:38.995
It became cross-cultural ed.

01:23:39.015 --> 01:23:41.859
It became crossing borders.

01:23:41.979 --> 01:23:50.589
It became also educating others, not just educating the kids, the Chicanos that were in my classes.

01:23:51.150 --> 01:23:53.592
It was also educating my peers.

01:23:55.074 --> 01:24:01.862
And, you know, and having the kids going into... The school became...

01:24:02.264 --> 01:24:07.830
creative and performing arts, having the kids make those.

01:24:10.472 --> 01:24:23.586
We put on a play, the kids in my classes and I, that the kids in my classes attended and the parents of the kids in my classes were the ones that attended.

01:24:24.867 --> 01:24:29.892
But the vision was to have people in the other

01:24:30.479 --> 01:24:33.063
And the rest of the community attended.

01:24:33.083 --> 01:24:33.864
Yeah.

01:24:33.884 --> 01:24:36.829
And experience it and grow with it.

01:24:36.849 --> 01:24:41.536
Is that how you connected with my dad?

01:24:41.556 --> 01:24:43.319
Yeah.

01:24:43.339 --> 01:24:46.845
Or were you guys connected before that?

01:24:48.487 --> 01:24:48.748
No.

01:24:50.671 --> 01:24:56.339
Because I know he did some work with the San Jose High students.

01:24:56.500 --> 01:24:56.740
Yeah.

01:24:56.973 --> 01:25:00.518
And I'm not sure, but I would assume probably some other students.

01:25:00.558 --> 01:25:08.088
He probably did some work, not he probably, he did some work with when I became involved more fully in bilingual ed.

01:25:08.108 --> 01:25:13.795
And I became the bilingual supervisor, bilingual supervisor for San Jose Unified.

01:25:13.975 --> 01:25:16.098
And then I became the bilingual director.

01:25:16.399 --> 01:25:20.204
And then we had a thing called the San Jose Area Bilingual Consortium.

01:25:20.684 --> 01:25:22.086
And the hub of it,

01:25:22.066 --> 01:25:24.751
was in San Jose Unified.

01:25:25.191 --> 01:25:34.067
But it was a group of 11 districts that all participated in a federal project in bilingual cross-cultural.

01:25:34.608 --> 01:25:37.894
And your dad was pretty involved with the bilingual.

01:25:37.914 --> 01:25:42.462
You may want to ask him, but that's where I remember him mostly from.

01:25:43.944 --> 01:25:44.445
Mm-hmm.

01:25:44.611 --> 01:25:47.836
the time in bilingual ed.

01:25:47.856 --> 01:25:48.477
Interesting.

01:25:49.399 --> 01:25:53.185
So, okay, let me go back to the mestizaje stuff.

01:25:53.205 --> 01:26:03.281
So we were just talking about your introduction with the concept being connected with your education and upbringing in Mexico, right?

01:26:03.301 --> 01:26:04.984
In Mexico City in particular.

01:26:06.186 --> 01:26:09.792
And we were just talking about kind of these parallels between

01:26:10.075 --> 01:26:27.156
chicanismo and indigenismo and so you were kind of talking about whether or not you were seeing I guess that's how we got onto that parallel between chicanismo and indigenismo but

01:26:27.676 --> 01:26:45.181
we were talking about whether or not you had seen this concept being utilized or you said that it was intuitive for those groups that were participating in the Chicano movement, right?

01:26:45.943 --> 01:26:52.773
And then I just wanted to know if there was anything more you wanted to add about that, like what were you seeing?

01:26:53.273 --> 01:26:55.877
How do you think or do you know

01:26:56.448 --> 01:27:04.876
Like, what was it that those people were... Where do you think they were introduced if it wasn't just intuitive?

01:27:05.377 --> 01:27:08.260
Like, were there books they were reading?

01:27:09.081 --> 01:27:13.405
No, I think, to tell you the truth, about half of the group was from Texas.

01:27:15.127 --> 01:27:15.647
Interesting.

01:27:15.788 --> 01:27:21.453
And I think that some of that they brought... Well, you know they brought with them.

01:27:21.473 --> 01:27:22.694
I mean, I brought mine with me.

01:27:22.775 --> 01:27:23.816
They brought theirs with them.

01:27:24.296 --> 01:27:26.218
And I've always...

01:27:26.587 --> 01:27:43.924
thought of that time, my exposure to my consciencia having been shaped to some extent by some of these folks that brought that with them from Texas.

01:27:44.705 --> 01:27:51.632
And they came with a similar kind of, you know, it seemed to me that they had had a fertile

01:27:52.102 --> 01:28:06.795
ground to open their minds and they came strong and were putting it into practice at San Jose State.

01:28:07.356 --> 01:28:21.889
It's like the practice of our awareness that we were meant to be here and that we were here to contribute

01:28:22.139 --> 01:28:24.743
and that we were not invisible.

01:28:25.383 --> 01:28:25.684
Right.

01:28:25.884 --> 01:28:29.249
I think we, different people brought that.

01:28:29.950 --> 01:28:30.470
Interesting.

01:28:30.590 --> 01:28:33.054
Yeah, there was a bunch of people from Tejas.

01:28:35.357 --> 01:28:44.169
Do you know, do you remember, like, where were they, like, from the borderlands or just everywhere?

01:28:44.509 --> 01:28:46.972
San Antonio, Houston?

01:28:48.515 --> 01:28:50.557
I don't know.

01:28:50.577 --> 01:28:50.677
Okay.

01:28:50.938 --> 01:28:51.859
I don't know.

01:28:52.328 --> 01:29:04.072
I haven't spent too much time thinking about it, but I do remember over the years now and then making those connections.

01:29:07.278 --> 01:29:13.611
Do you see this idea of mestizaje or mestizo identity?

01:29:14.384 --> 01:29:17.608
Have you seen it since the Chicano movement?

01:29:17.668 --> 01:29:29.704
Do you hear a lot of people making reference to it or anything like that, like in more contemporary times?

01:29:30.666 --> 01:29:31.707
You know, I don't.

01:29:31.727 --> 01:29:33.509
I retired in 2012.

01:29:35.412 --> 01:29:40.138
And I think it's...

01:29:41.401 --> 01:30:09.501
think it's I don't know I think I need to think about it and I need to explore it a little bit but I I think of it more as chicanismo for me and and so it's something that I'm I need to understand better because I think it's is it new jargon is it is it a new is it a further development of that that that

01:30:10.882 --> 01:30:14.487
I need to label a little bit more for myself.

01:30:16.370 --> 01:30:16.670
Yeah.

01:30:16.750 --> 01:30:20.675
Well, I mean, so it's not a, it's not new jargon.

01:30:21.016 --> 01:30:27.705
It's been around for at least 400 or 500 years.

01:30:30.188 --> 01:30:34.975
But, but it is, I mean, the concept of it, right.

01:30:34.995 --> 01:30:36.157
And maybe the name.

01:30:37.539 --> 01:30:37.819
Yeah.

01:30:37.899 --> 01:30:40.062
Maybe like the, the,

01:30:41.122 --> 01:30:52.852
It probably wasn't being used as an actual term until, or a popular term, until maybe like the end of the 1500s.

01:30:54.334 --> 01:31:04.703
But this is, it's one of the, you know, the castas that were used in Mexico, you know, during the colonial period.

01:31:04.723 --> 01:31:06.504
Right, right, right.

01:31:06.524 --> 01:31:08.006
So it was one of the castas, right?

01:31:09.026 --> 01:31:10.808
Yeah, I'm familiar with that, but

01:31:11.108 --> 01:31:35.209
as a um being connected with like mexican americans or chicanos in the right right yeah yeah so that's kind of what my my project is about exactly so um and and what i have found so far in my research is that since maybe the late

01:31:35.425 --> 01:32:03.795
70s to the between like the 80s and the 90s and even up to now is that this concept of mestizaje is being used as a kind of method for addressing or talking about Latinos in general right so and you see it in a lot of different fields too so history sociology art literature

01:32:04.265 --> 01:32:33.934
like tons of stuff right and and that's basically like what my project is about is to say hold on all of these like contemporary scholars are using this thing and we don't even have a grip on you know what this thing is so that's that's kind of what my project is about is to to do that investigation yeah um but uh yeah you know i can't think of like

01:32:37.002 --> 01:32:50.296
In most of my other discussions with everybody else, and I think what is unique about my discussion with you is that you are actually from a majority raised in Mexico.

01:32:50.316 --> 01:33:02.888
So you have a completely different upbringing than everybody else that I've talked to who's born here, whose families have been here for maybe, who are like your family, right?

01:33:02.929 --> 01:33:04.410
Their parents came over.

01:33:04.711 --> 01:33:11.220
either during or after the revolution, and had families here, but the families stayed here.

01:33:11.260 --> 01:33:13.283
They didn't go back to Mexico, right?

01:33:13.303 --> 01:33:14.164
Right, right.

01:33:14.304 --> 01:33:24.499
And so your perspective and your experience is really, really interesting and different from these other conversations that I've been having.

01:33:25.640 --> 01:33:33.992
So, and it's not to say like, you know, I think it's really fascinating that

01:33:34.445 --> 01:33:44.795
that we were kind of able to get this or to be able to see this kind of parallel between Chicanismo and Bigenismo.

01:33:46.016 --> 01:33:51.721
So I'm kind of excited about that.

01:33:52.983 --> 01:33:58.328
It's also a creative tension issue, isn't it?

01:33:58.348 --> 01:34:02.832
You need to tell me more about this creative tension stuff that you're talking about.

01:34:04.027 --> 01:34:08.251
related to mestizaje, what does that mean?

01:34:10.352 --> 01:34:32.852
Is it, is it that you're acknowledging your indigena roots or is it that you're not you, but I mean that you're, yeah, that's, that's, that's always been my, my dissertation chair.

01:34:33.423 --> 01:34:36.887
And I had long conversations.

01:34:36.907 --> 01:34:43.774
And she helped me to get through some of that resenta that I was telling you about.

01:34:46.477 --> 01:34:58.030
But is it embracing my mestizaje, meaning my European roots,

01:34:59.815 --> 01:35:06.043
doing a disservice to my indigenous roots.

01:35:08.186 --> 01:35:10.850
That's a creative tension issue for me.

01:35:11.751 --> 01:35:28.894
Because even though... Yeah, you know, it's like, where is that, where is my ability

01:35:29.414 --> 01:35:44.796
as a human being, for me to practice what I preach in terms of accepting and embracing if I'm not necessarily willing to do that fully for my European roots.

01:35:47.500 --> 01:35:48.562
Does that make any sense?

01:35:49.864 --> 01:35:50.044
No.

01:35:50.825 --> 01:35:56.974
No, it does because I think, well, I think I understand what you're saying as

01:35:58.338 --> 01:36:23.234
It's like my anger at the colony of the barbaridades that they brought to my people, my gente, my roots, my native roots, is still not reconciled.

01:36:23.595 --> 01:36:23.915
Right.

01:36:24.877 --> 01:36:27.180
For me to say that I embrace...

01:36:27.937 --> 01:36:31.443
my European roots.

01:36:31.463 --> 01:36:40.917
And yet it's, you know, I mean, it's you, I mean, it runs, it runs in your veins, right?

01:36:42.480 --> 01:36:47.247
And so even discussing it as my mestizaje, what does that mean?

01:36:47.688 --> 01:36:51.554
Is the, is that terminology itself?

01:36:51.634 --> 01:36:55.260
It's the, it's, um,

01:36:57.451 --> 01:37:01.915
Do you mean by mestizaje that there's an acknowledgement of the indigenous?

01:37:03.016 --> 01:37:06.900
Well, it's supposed to be an acknowledgement of both.

01:37:08.061 --> 01:37:08.542
See that?

01:37:09.082 --> 01:37:09.442
Right.

01:37:09.703 --> 01:37:14.607
And to say, like, you know, we were just talking about Bolivar, right?

01:37:14.888 --> 01:37:15.028
Right.

01:37:15.048 --> 01:37:27.019
Bolivar is one of the first political figures to talk about mestizaje as this thing that brings us together, right?

01:37:27.573 --> 01:37:31.499
Oh, we're not indigenous and we're not European.

01:37:31.580 --> 01:37:33.943
We're a species midway, is what he says.

01:37:34.644 --> 01:37:35.266
And Afro.

01:37:36.407 --> 01:37:37.609
No, he doesn't.

01:37:37.730 --> 01:37:39.052
Big time slavery.

01:37:39.072 --> 01:37:43.880
Well, yes, true, but Bolivar doesn't mention that.

01:37:43.940 --> 01:37:45.202
Doesn't get there, huh?

01:37:45.222 --> 01:37:46.003
Right.

01:37:46.023 --> 01:37:51.752
And the thing to remember, too, about Bolivar is that he is a criollo.

01:37:51.873 --> 01:37:53.275
Right, right.

01:37:53.295 --> 01:37:54.036
So...

01:37:55.484 --> 01:38:11.354
So mestizaje, you know, during the colonial period and up to the independence era, it's a status, right?

01:38:12.216 --> 01:38:15.602
It means that you're much closer to being...

01:38:15.768 --> 01:38:16.549
European.

01:38:16.569 --> 01:38:18.291
European than you are to those.

01:38:18.451 --> 01:38:19.752
That's my point.

01:38:19.913 --> 01:38:21.554
That's why I'm struggling with it.

01:38:21.574 --> 01:38:23.296
That's why I'm struggling with it.

01:38:23.496 --> 01:38:24.017
Yeah.

01:38:24.037 --> 01:38:25.198
Indiginals, right?

01:38:25.218 --> 01:38:25.439
Right.

01:38:25.899 --> 01:38:26.860
The class thing.

01:38:26.920 --> 01:38:27.200
Yeah.

01:38:27.221 --> 01:38:28.802
The class thing that I was telling you about.

01:38:28.822 --> 01:38:29.083
Yeah.

01:38:29.603 --> 01:38:39.334
So, I mean, that's reality and it's still there and it's going to continue.

01:38:40.014 --> 01:38:40.635
It's been there.

01:38:41.096 --> 01:38:41.656
Yeah.

01:38:41.676 --> 01:38:45.100
But it's that conciencia, that awareness that is there.

01:38:45.991 --> 01:39:00.489
And to what extent do you respect yourself and what makes you up so that you can have that respect for others?

01:39:00.509 --> 01:39:04.835
I mean, fully respect others across those classes.

01:39:04.915 --> 01:39:14.327
Maybe here is more ethnic and racial and linguistic, but in Mexico, I mean, it's pretty, it's pretty bad.

01:39:14.864 --> 01:39:16.706
Yeah, a class.

01:39:17.668 --> 01:39:24.516
Yeah, and I think, I mean, you could probably say the same for Mexico, too, right?

01:39:24.577 --> 01:39:26.499
That they have class issues.

01:39:26.900 --> 01:39:28.081
They have race issues.

01:39:28.261 --> 01:39:29.303
Right.

01:39:29.383 --> 01:39:31.846
They also have language issues, right?

01:39:31.866 --> 01:39:37.273
Spanish is the official language, not, you know, Nahuatl.

01:39:37.293 --> 01:39:44.382
El racismo might be even worse in Latin America than it is here, because here we're confronting it.

01:39:45.543 --> 01:39:45.923
Yeah.

01:39:46.744 --> 01:39:47.004
Yeah.

01:39:47.085 --> 01:39:53.371
And I think that's, that's kind of wrapped up with the, the idea of mestizaje, right?

01:39:53.971 --> 01:40:03.160
Mestizaje to me, my, my understanding of it is, are you familiar with like colorblind, colorblindness, right?

01:40:03.180 --> 01:40:04.402
Well, I don't see race.

01:40:04.462 --> 01:40:06.303
I, everybody's, right, right, right, right.

01:40:06.383 --> 01:40:07.244
That's colorblindness.

01:40:07.885 --> 01:40:14.031
That's mestizaje, but like 200, 300 years before colorblind,

01:40:14.568 --> 01:40:30.766
ideology here right so if everybody hey we're not you're not Indian you're not white we're all Mexican right right so in that sense I could see what you're saying you know like here in the U.S.

01:40:31.186 --> 01:40:43.039
we're speaking out about it whereas in Mexico it's it's kind of just not really discussed how can you discuss race if everybody's Mexican right

01:40:45.263 --> 01:40:49.809
So, yeah, did you have anything else you wanted to add about that?

01:40:50.029 --> 01:40:54.816
Well... I can see your brain is working.

01:40:54.836 --> 01:40:59.642
I was just going to say that.

01:41:00.143 --> 01:41:14.562
A lot of watering of my ground here with the... You know, the concept of... You have brought some...

01:41:15.875 --> 01:41:21.562
fertilizer to the party.

01:41:22.503 --> 01:41:23.544
It's interesting.

01:41:23.865 --> 01:41:26.088
Maybe someday I'll reconcile with that.

01:41:27.329 --> 01:41:31.935
And yet, DNA-wise, it's actually very interesting.

01:41:32.015 --> 01:41:34.218
I'll send you my DNA stuff so you can see it.

01:41:34.658 --> 01:41:42.608
It's very interesting because I've always gravitated to what I thought my

01:41:42.942 --> 01:41:51.413
My roots were more, I mean, they still are, you know, in my, in my, in my conciencia and in my heart.

01:41:52.154 --> 01:41:56.078
But in terms of DNA, it's a little different than I expected.

01:41:57.300 --> 01:41:57.560
Yeah.

01:41:57.721 --> 01:41:59.102
Very different than I expected.

01:41:59.703 --> 01:42:10.857
One of my, my mom's aunts, she did a DNA and was surprised to see that she was like, I don't know, whatever it was.

01:42:11.478 --> 01:42:14.041
60% Native, right?

01:42:14.802 --> 01:42:18.526
And she's like, who in our family is Native?

01:42:19.587 --> 01:42:20.909
I'm like, hello.

01:42:20.929 --> 01:42:23.111
And for me, it was the other way around.

01:42:24.173 --> 01:42:25.654
Where is it?

01:42:25.674 --> 01:42:26.295
Where is it?

01:42:26.956 --> 01:42:28.237
I need validation here.

01:42:28.798 --> 01:42:30.380
My heart needs validation here.

01:42:30.961 --> 01:42:32.642
And the DNA didn't do that.

01:42:32.662 --> 01:42:39.190
And you know, speaking of the DNA stuff, what's funny about it is that

01:42:39.895 --> 01:42:50.849
A lot of those databases, they have a lot of, whether it's Ancestry.com that they get it from or, you know, the 23andMe, whatever it is.

01:42:52.751 --> 01:42:56.836
They don't have a lot of collections of indigenous DNA.

01:42:58.017 --> 01:43:01.802
And so when they do the testing...

01:43:02.322 --> 01:43:08.612
They look at their database and they say, oh, well, okay, this person has more of this and less of this over here.

01:43:08.632 --> 01:43:10.235
Because the pool is not complete.

01:43:10.255 --> 01:43:11.858
Yes, because the pool is small.

01:43:12.279 --> 01:43:12.579
Okay.

01:43:12.599 --> 01:43:12.859
Right?

01:43:13.621 --> 01:43:21.173
So, I mean, it could turn out, like, if you had everybody's DNA on the planet, right, it would be vastly different.

01:43:21.314 --> 01:43:23.838
But you don't have everybody's DNA on the planet.

01:43:23.918 --> 01:43:24.459
Exactly.

01:43:24.499 --> 01:43:27.664
So you only go with, you know, the pools that you have the most of.

01:43:28.105 --> 01:43:28.245
Mm-hmm.

01:43:28.462 --> 01:43:29.283
Yeah, that's true.

01:43:29.583 --> 01:43:30.385
That's good.

01:43:30.625 --> 01:43:32.167
It's good to think about it.

01:43:32.327 --> 01:43:36.452
So just remember, it's probably a little bit inaccurate.

01:43:37.113 --> 01:43:43.922
Which is really interesting, too, because... But it's kind of... It's interrupting me.

01:43:44.283 --> 01:43:47.687
Yeah, because... I'm kind of sorry I did it.

01:43:48.108 --> 01:43:56.499
It uses... I mean, I don't want to call it pseudoscience, but it uses science... It's limited.

01:43:57.240 --> 01:43:57.540
And what...

01:43:57.740 --> 01:44:00.985
And there's so much reverence in science today.

01:44:01.045 --> 01:44:03.749
Like, oh, science is 100% correct, right?

01:44:04.269 --> 01:44:06.613
So when you see... Yes, exactly.

01:44:06.633 --> 01:44:16.207
So when you see something like that, people are... They're quick to jump on the results, right?

01:44:16.347 --> 01:44:22.476
Without thinking about, okay, well, what are all the different elements that go into those results, right?

01:44:22.896 --> 01:44:25.500
What is the pull of all your DNA donors?

01:44:25.620 --> 01:44:27.443
What is the, you know...

01:44:27.710 --> 01:44:37.200
How much historical records do you have on that population of people as opposed to this other population of people, right?

01:44:37.640 --> 01:44:50.334
And then when you start thinking about the history, oh, and now you're telling me that this whole population of people have been almost, you know, gone through a complete genocide.

01:44:50.374 --> 01:44:56.841
And on top of that, you know, you have these other people who are coming in and dominating, you know.

01:44:56.861 --> 01:44:57.261
Right.

01:44:57.781 --> 01:45:19.688
dominating so yeah there's all sorts of stuff that you know we just we we forget to think about because we have been taught for so long that science is right you know and it it also makes us lazy that too i mean why stop yeah just because

01:45:20.798 --> 01:45:24.222
They're the last word on the subject?

01:45:24.322 --> 01:45:24.622
No.

01:45:24.983 --> 01:45:27.285
Yeah, yeah, exactly.

01:45:27.305 --> 01:45:28.146
¿No quieres un panecito?

01:45:29.288 --> 01:45:30.449
No, thank you.

01:45:30.489 --> 01:45:35.014
I'm like, I told you I had a chorizo on eggs.

01:45:35.715 --> 01:45:37.137
And I'm like, oh.

01:45:38.018 --> 01:45:40.701
So I'm trying to take turns on the download.

01:45:40.721 --> 01:45:41.281
I'm so sorry.

01:45:41.341 --> 01:45:43.203
My house is a mess.

01:45:43.364 --> 01:45:44.525
I would have clinked.

01:45:44.545 --> 01:45:46.187
No, no, no, it's okay.

01:45:46.307 --> 01:45:46.367
No.

01:45:46.887 --> 01:46:15.898
um but yeah so I think that that's really helpful even though it wasn't you know we didn't have a very long conversation about the mestizaje stuff but I think a lot of that is is really helpful and yeah because acknowledging my mestizaje kind of gets in the way of my pride for my roots yeah what I think of as my roots yeah you know what I'm saying yeah

01:46:17.009 --> 01:46:19.092
And so I need to think about it.

01:46:19.112 --> 01:46:20.113
I need to think about it.

01:46:21.094 --> 01:46:43.422
I feel very comfortable with Chicanismo and being a Chicana and having grown, I think, you know, I think having been formed and helping to form it because of when I had the privilege of...

01:46:45.562 --> 01:46:54.395
of having conversations with people about it, you know, right at the crossroads, the 60s and the 70s and the 80s, you know what I mean?

01:46:54.415 --> 01:46:54.615
Yeah.

01:46:55.056 --> 01:46:59.983
And so it's been a privilege, but it's not finished.

01:47:00.945 --> 01:47:07.755
Yeah, that also reminded me of, you know, this...

01:47:08.900 --> 01:47:21.433
Since the Chicano movement, there has been more and more of a shift to want to label us as Latinos.

01:47:21.934 --> 01:47:22.234
Right.

01:47:22.254 --> 01:47:23.175
Hispanics.

01:47:23.195 --> 01:47:23.716
Right.

01:47:23.736 --> 01:47:24.056
Right.

01:47:24.516 --> 01:47:27.540
And if we are calling ourselves mestizos.

01:47:27.620 --> 01:47:28.040
Right.

01:47:28.060 --> 01:47:28.220
Right.

01:47:28.280 --> 01:47:36.309
That's just another one of these kind of like all-encompassing, lumping terms of identity.

01:47:36.329 --> 01:47:36.409
Yes.

01:47:36.693 --> 01:47:43.522
That doesn't get to the root of, you know, yeah, we're all one rasa, right?

01:47:43.662 --> 01:47:46.465
But we have different experiences.

01:47:46.526 --> 01:47:47.727
We have different histories.

01:47:50.170 --> 01:47:54.115
We have different responses to those histories, right?

01:47:54.816 --> 01:47:58.020
And you know what else just ran across my mind?

01:47:58.100 --> 01:48:06.531
It lacks for me, and I need to do some thinking about it and some reading about it.

01:48:07.287 --> 01:48:20.101
But it lacks the posture, the attitude that I find in Chicanismo.

01:48:20.121 --> 01:48:20.922
Right, right.

01:48:20.942 --> 01:48:23.104
In Chicanismo, I have that.

01:48:23.825 --> 01:48:24.125
Yeah.

01:48:24.205 --> 01:48:24.846
It feels good.

01:48:25.507 --> 01:48:26.728
It feels mine.

01:48:28.450 --> 01:48:35.117
And I've never found it in Latina, Hispana.

01:48:35.553 --> 01:48:39.698
Latin American, Mexican American.

01:48:39.778 --> 01:48:43.964
I've never found it in any... In Mexican, I have.

01:48:43.984 --> 01:48:45.005
In Mexicana, I have.

01:48:46.307 --> 01:48:49.451
But I recognize, you know, what?

01:48:49.491 --> 01:48:52.895
I came to the United States more than I have a century ago.

01:48:53.616 --> 01:49:00.885
So, yes, my roots are Mexican, Mexicana, but they are also other...

01:49:02.047 --> 01:49:20.866
that I have gained, you know, in my experiences here and working for and learning with and from the community that, you know, embraced me.

01:49:21.687 --> 01:49:29.775
Yeah, and I wonder, like, I don't know, maybe you can answer this, but I wonder if that

01:49:30.093 --> 01:49:37.061
That attitude and pride that you are talking about in terms of chicanismo.

01:49:37.341 --> 01:49:38.483
Posture.

01:49:38.663 --> 01:49:40.045
Yes, the posture, right?

01:49:41.086 --> 01:49:44.450
As opposed to Latino, Hispanic, whatever.

01:49:46.552 --> 01:49:48.314
Those are labels.

01:49:48.695 --> 01:49:51.198
Yeah.

01:49:53.821 --> 01:49:59.307
But it's also because chicanismo and chicano and chicana...

01:49:59.928 --> 01:50:24.535
are things that came out of the community right it wasn't somebody in their office oh we're gonna call them latinos now yes yes we're gonna put hispanic on the census right that this was something that you as members of this group said no we're not we're not those people this is who we are like it was a decision that

01:50:25.088 --> 01:50:31.739
that those people made for themselves rather than somebody else telling them, this is who you are.

01:50:32.861 --> 01:50:35.365
That's what I think, but you tell me.

01:50:35.946 --> 01:50:36.326
Yeah.

01:50:38.129 --> 01:50:39.432
I have to think about that one too.

01:50:40.874 --> 01:50:44.660
It's intuitive.

01:50:44.680 --> 01:50:46.744
It's not something I necessarily have to think of.

01:50:46.844 --> 01:50:49.128
It's not my label.

01:50:49.148 --> 01:50:50.390
It's my posture.

01:50:50.870 --> 01:50:51.231
Right.

01:50:52.223 --> 01:50:53.004
It's who you are.

01:50:53.224 --> 01:50:53.965
It's who I am.

01:50:54.186 --> 01:50:56.128
It's my attitude.

01:50:58.752 --> 01:51:03.398
When you talked to Luis, did he bring up Corky's poem?

01:51:03.619 --> 01:51:05.001
Yeah.

01:51:05.581 --> 01:51:08.065
That's always been a good anchor for me.

01:51:08.586 --> 01:51:09.447
Yeah.

01:51:09.647 --> 01:51:10.448
That aha.

01:51:11.450 --> 01:51:20.442
And this is when I was a young teacher at San Jose High when I was doing Chicano studies that I ran across it.

01:51:21.113 --> 01:51:21.614
Yeah.

01:51:21.634 --> 01:51:32.086
That was not only something that, that, um, uh, that we talked about and incorporated, but it's something that gave me a very important aha.

01:51:34.549 --> 01:51:35.550
Yeah.

01:51:35.630 --> 01:51:46.743
And it's interesting too, because Corky's poem is coming up a lot with, um, with people who were involved in the Chicano movement.

01:51:46.803 --> 01:51:47.203
Right.

01:51:47.243 --> 01:51:50.327
So all the people that I'm talking to, um,

01:51:50.999 --> 01:51:57.906
And what's interesting about it is that it has, it talks about that mestizaje, right?

01:51:57.926 --> 01:52:03.071
Of being both the colonizer and the colonized.

01:52:03.952 --> 01:52:10.078
So I, when I... And that's the reconciliation that I'm talking about.

01:52:10.118 --> 01:52:10.218
Yeah.

01:52:10.238 --> 01:52:11.279
That I am not fully there.

01:52:11.479 --> 01:52:13.681
And I'm 72, I better hurry up.

01:52:16.564 --> 01:52:17.085
Yeah.

01:52:18.146 --> 01:52:20.668
But, and I wonder, like, I don't know,

01:52:20.902 --> 01:52:23.244
Maybe I shouldn't wonder this stuff out loud.

01:52:23.264 --> 01:52:26.607
Maybe I'll just write it down.

01:52:26.627 --> 01:52:49.508
But no, I was just thinking about... Because I think... You know how I was saying that... These scholars who have... In the past 20 or 30 years... Who have been using mestizaje as a method... That they see it as a reconciliation...

01:52:50.602 --> 01:52:50.983
Right.

01:52:52.305 --> 01:52:54.308
They see it as a reconciliation.

01:52:54.348 --> 01:53:00.518
Like, oh, see, we have it's possible to be two conflicting things at once.

01:53:00.878 --> 01:53:02.380
That's the reconciliation.

01:53:02.641 --> 01:53:03.983
Right.

01:53:04.003 --> 01:53:14.059
And and I think what what I'd like to do is to dig a little deeper and see where people are are using it in that way.

01:53:14.680 --> 01:53:14.820
Mm hmm.

01:53:14.952 --> 01:53:20.700
And people who are using it maybe like quirky to say, there's no reconciliation here.

01:53:20.760 --> 01:53:24.145
And that's just part of like, and that's part of the creative tension.

01:53:24.405 --> 01:53:24.745
Yeah.

01:53:25.246 --> 01:53:25.927
Right.

01:53:25.947 --> 01:53:30.053
Get us back to the creative tension, which I really like.

01:53:30.113 --> 01:53:37.223
And I hope you'll tell me a little bit more about it, maybe through email or something, but, um, yeah.

01:53:38.144 --> 01:53:39.085
So this is really good.

01:53:39.185 --> 01:53:41.208
Very, very fruitful discussion.

01:53:41.228 --> 01:53:41.689
Thank you.

01:53:42.630 --> 01:53:43.651
Um, likewise.

01:53:43.892 --> 01:53:44.773
Thank you.

01:53:45.310 --> 01:53:57.033
Is there anything else you'd want to add or you think I didn't ask you about or you want to talk about for posterity?

01:53:59.037 --> 01:54:04.888
I'd like to read a little bit what you might suggest.

01:54:05.830 --> 01:54:08.777
that might help me to catch up a little.

01:54:08.797 --> 01:54:15.292
Because I'm thinking, I've stayed busy, you know, I substitute in Central Unified and whatnot, and I've stayed busy in that sense.

01:54:15.833 --> 01:54:19.502
But in terms of staying busy with

01:54:21.237 --> 01:54:35.699
I've kind of taken a break from reading, and I'd like to pick up a couple of books that will help me to catch up a little bit on what's been discussed in the last maybe decade in Mesti Safi.

01:54:35.999 --> 01:54:37.121
Yeah.

01:54:38.183 --> 01:54:48.358
Well, I mean, there are a lot of, like some of the books that I'm looking at that are using it in that way that I was saying,

01:54:48.895 --> 01:54:54.060
are going to be books like maybe you're familiar with Gloria Anzaldua.

01:54:54.961 --> 01:54:56.522
She writes a lot about it.

01:55:00.186 --> 01:55:09.615
And now I don't necessarily agree with her, but this would just be like, here's how people are using it.

01:55:09.635 --> 01:55:14.680
Because the contemporary scholars are looking at her, right?

01:55:14.700 --> 01:55:15.501
They're using her.

01:55:15.521 --> 01:55:17.603
It would be interesting to see what she looked at.

01:55:18.258 --> 01:55:29.633
She looked at Vasconcelos and a lot of the stuff that was coming out of the Chicano movement is where she's getting her ideas from.

01:55:29.833 --> 01:55:35.301
And I've had like, I've talked to some people who say like, oh no, she's not like Vasconcelos at all.

01:55:35.441 --> 01:55:37.303
And I'm like, where are you finding this?

01:55:37.363 --> 01:55:40.808
Like who has done the research on this?

01:55:40.828 --> 01:55:42.030
And they disappear.

01:55:42.791 --> 01:55:44.493
Okay.

01:55:44.553 --> 01:55:44.653
Okay.

01:55:44.903 --> 01:56:12.919
but um let me get my phone so I can write it down yeah so her work would be like just to kind of get a baseline of what these other contemporary scholars are basing their stuff on here I'll tear you out a piece of mine you're not gonna mess up your I don't know maybe I don't know how it works yeah be careful

01:56:13.473 --> 01:56:15.375
If you do that, don't tear the whole thing.

Yeah, she was, yeah, she's interesting.

01:59:27.753 --> 01:59:40.110
I ran across her on Facebook, and I saw her art, and so we started talking in Facebook.

01:59:40.478 --> 01:59:41.579
Are those all of hers?

01:59:41.819 --> 01:59:42.660
These two are hers.

01:59:43.721 --> 01:59:45.483
And this one, she put this one up.

01:59:46.264 --> 01:59:50.929
And my first granddaughter, Siomara is her name.

01:59:51.369 --> 01:59:52.730
She's an angel in heaven.

01:59:53.651 --> 01:59:55.894
But this is about how old she would be.

01:59:56.815 --> 01:59:58.977

02:00:00.378 --> 02:00:03.321
And then she posted something else.

02:00:03.862 --> 02:00:06.604

02:00:27.250 --> 02:00:31.916
