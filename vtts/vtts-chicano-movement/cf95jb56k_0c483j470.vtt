WEBVTT

00:00.031 --> 00:02.374
Yeah, but we're not there yet.

00:02.394 --> 00:06.300
So we were just talking about... And you could have talked louder, I think.

00:06.901 --> 00:07.081
Alright.

00:07.101 --> 00:07.502
Please.

00:08.583 --> 00:10.606
You said alright, and that's barely.

00:12.669 --> 00:15.873
Okay, well, so we were just talking about Aslan, right?

00:16.574 --> 00:24.646
And where you first heard about that, or where that kind of first entered your consciousness.

00:27.169 --> 00:28.992
Um... So...

00:32.954 --> 00:43.605
I want to say that that came out of the... I want to say it came out of Colorado.

00:45.027 --> 00:45.567
What's his name?

00:46.228 --> 00:47.389
Corky Gonzalez.

00:47.409 --> 00:48.570
Corky Gonzalez.

00:51.073 --> 00:57.620
I don't even know if he mentions the Aslan in his epic I Am Joaquin.

00:58.801 --> 00:59.161
He does?

00:59.522 --> 01:00.082
Oh, I don't know.

01:00.242 --> 01:00.583
I don't know.

01:00.603 --> 01:02.725
But if he does, then that's...

01:03.110 --> 01:04.812
That's probably where it came from.

01:05.794 --> 01:07.996
That would be where it came from.

01:08.017 --> 01:21.294
I know it came from that because he wrote that poem, and the Teatro Campesino, Luis, made it into a little movie, that that was, what's the word, cathartic?

01:21.314 --> 01:24.418
It was like, fuck yeah, we shall endure.

01:24.719 --> 01:31.007
In other words, it's not just a simple...

01:31.628 --> 01:39.316
group of people complain about how they were treated over here in Colorado or New Mexico, but rather that we're all a part of something bigger.

01:41.579 --> 01:50.849
And that poem, Corky, they were the ones fomenting, promoting propaganda of Aslan.

01:51.469 --> 01:56.615
And then Alurista and the student, the student proclamation.

01:57.576 --> 01:58.417
The plan.

01:58.437 --> 01:59.458
Plan de Aslan.

01:59.877 --> 02:00.498
Yeah.

02:00.598 --> 02:01.759
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

02:02.060 --> 02:03.902
I thought you were talking about the Santa Barbara.

02:03.922 --> 02:05.324
No, not the Santa Barbara.

02:05.344 --> 02:18.521
And so those were the beginnings of that, and then the rest is what we all... So you think that... Okay, so... Tijerina was not talking about Aslan.

02:18.701 --> 02:19.041
Right.

02:20.403 --> 02:23.967
The Ras Unida Party was not talking about Aslan.

02:23.987 --> 02:24.088
Yeah.

02:24.108 --> 02:25.609
Corky was talking about Aslan.

02:25.890 --> 02:27.832
The Teatro was talking about Aslan.

02:28.293 --> 02:28.433
Mm-hmm.

02:28.987 --> 02:30.770
So that's what Chavez wasn't talking about.

02:31.450 --> 02:32.151
Yeah.

02:34.034 --> 02:35.516
Well, I mean, okay, so.

02:35.536 --> 02:37.419
Oh, just to give you a. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

02:37.519 --> 02:40.844
No, but I just want to kind of be clear on.

02:40.944 --> 02:55.985
So you think that you, that it was Corky's poem that was then kind of like adopted by the teatro and that that's how you first encountered that concept.

02:56.005 --> 02:56.926
Yeah, through the teatro.

02:56.946 --> 02:57.047
Yeah.

02:57.067 --> 02:57.407
Yeah.

02:58.771 --> 03:01.875
So, like, when you were 18, 19 years old.

03:02.115 --> 03:09.043
And the other one for me would be Agustin Lira.

03:10.285 --> 03:15.771
Yeah, Agustin Lira, folk singer with a teatro.

03:16.753 --> 03:17.033
Yeah.

03:17.634 --> 03:27.986
Who, one of his favorite songs I always liked was... What the hell was the name of it?

03:28.006 --> 03:28.727
Shit, man.

03:29.365 --> 03:34.230
I know I'm getting old now.

03:35.791 --> 03:37.473
Brown-eyed children of the sun?

03:38.194 --> 03:39.956
No.

03:39.976 --> 03:41.277
What songs did he write?

03:42.358 --> 03:48.584
That he spent years... The hell's the name?

03:49.145 --> 03:49.926
Que hubo raza.

03:50.326 --> 03:50.967
Oh, uh-huh.

03:51.667 --> 03:57.313
Bueno pues que hubo y como les va que lindo dÃ­a para cantar noticias.

03:57.833 --> 04:15.395
Anyway, so in one little short song, he gives the issue in New Mexico, Colorado, we're never going to become gringos, you know, all of that.

04:16.616 --> 04:22.363
So that had a definite impact.

04:23.144 --> 04:27.610
And Agustin was part of the Teatro Campesino?

04:27.690 --> 04:27.790
Yeah.

04:28.428 --> 04:32.153
Him and Luis are the ones that started the Teatro Campesino with the farm workers.

04:34.116 --> 04:57.591
Okay, so then I think this is probably a good transition into the mestizaje stuff because that comes up pretty prominently in... Well, in the poem, I am Joaquin, he alludes to the mestizaje in the sense that in his... I guess in his view at the time, he...

04:58.195 --> 05:11.997
He saw us as, as he probably read the shit about and all of that because he's talking about that we're, we're, he's the one that came out with that triple face.

05:12.017 --> 05:12.298
Yeah.

05:12.839 --> 05:13.420
Spaniard.

05:13.700 --> 05:15.443
I thought that was Alorista.

05:16.024 --> 05:16.345
No.

05:16.365 --> 05:17.046
Oh, okay.

05:17.066 --> 05:20.011
Spaniard, Indian, and Chicano.

05:20.171 --> 05:20.471
Yeah.

05:21.773 --> 05:24.017
So it, it came out of Denver.

05:27.237 --> 05:56.383
promoted it like that so how did you okay so that i think that's a good maybe characterization of how quirky gonzalez uh introduced it or understood it did you ever so would you say that maybe that was your first encounter with that idea of messy for me

05:58.287 --> 06:26.185
I want to say yes, but for some doggone reason in the back of my head, I keep thinking that somewhere in the Mexican community, the idea that we were half Indian and half Spanish was there in general, which is probably how quirky

06:27.346 --> 06:29.108
Kind of picked that up or something.

06:29.128 --> 06:29.568
Yeah.

06:29.588 --> 06:33.352
Unless he read something about Miss Isake somewhere.

06:33.912 --> 06:46.304
But just the idea of being mixed, you know, it's like here in the United States, you know, there isn't any purity of ethnicity.

06:46.324 --> 06:48.125
So they're mixed.

06:48.626 --> 06:49.106
Yeah.

06:49.126 --> 06:50.428
So they saw themselves as mixed.

06:50.488 --> 06:55.092
And after 500 years of the Spaniards and French and whoever the hell else in Mexico,

06:56.371 --> 07:02.639
The simplistic view is to say, oh, well, I'm half Indian and half Mexican or Spanish.

07:06.064 --> 07:16.799
Did you ever at any point in your time, like, I'm sure you have given the things that you have already talked about on, like, the evolution of your thought.

07:17.840 --> 07:17.940
Yeah.

07:17.960 --> 07:25.230
Was there any point in time where you believed that you were mixed, like that, mestizaje kind?

07:25.700 --> 07:28.384
Like, did you identify with that?

07:28.404 --> 07:30.587
I never identified with the mestizaje.

07:30.988 --> 07:39.039
And I was always suspect of the actual Spanish in me that might be there.

07:40.001 --> 07:54.762
And I've never been, and I've never, and that's only because of stories in the familia about a Spanish root or connection or whatever you want to call it.

07:55.180 --> 08:04.193
But the strongest connection for me has always been our native element.

08:04.213 --> 08:24.782
And as a result of that, I remember I developed a teatro exercise, and I developed that at Santa Clara University where I was mainly talking with gringos, gringo students that had no, that I didn't just consider a class or whatever.

08:25.133 --> 08:33.666
So the exercise was that I would tell them that the room or classroom was a map of the United States.

08:33.686 --> 08:36.270
You did that with us at this map conference.

08:36.290 --> 08:39.154
Oh, good.

08:39.575 --> 08:49.470
So I used that exercise to have them have a transitional history of

08:49.973 --> 08:54.159
how they came to be where they are, that they just didn't.

08:54.179 --> 08:55.561
They're not just from here.

08:56.803 --> 09:18.613
And because they were mostly gringos in my class there, and I had a four or five raza that were there, the five raza, let's say the five raza and the 50 white students would all end up standing up against the walls because they weren't anywhere rooted in the United States boundaries.

09:19.117 --> 09:32.037
And the only ones left were, let's say three of the five Raza students, three of them were born or ended up with roots in Mexico, some state in Mexico.

09:33.258 --> 09:38.606
One, maybe two, like Texas or New Mexico.

09:38.627 --> 09:46.238
And so that then would allow me to give an explanation of how we see our,

09:46.775 --> 09:53.766
ancestral roots being from here and not from Asia or Germany or whatever.

09:57.711 --> 09:59.815
So what am I answering?

09:59.875 --> 10:00.876
The thing about mestizo?

10:02.399 --> 10:10.971
Yeah, we were talking about mestizo and whether or not you felt like you at any point in your life identified as mestizo.

10:11.632 --> 10:13.615
I don't think I ever identified as mestizo.

10:13.736 --> 10:16.039
I always identified as

10:16.880 --> 10:23.810
Tejano and then Mexicano, Northern Mexicano.

10:23.870 --> 10:38.271
Cause I wasn't like from where your mom is from Zacatecas or Northern, Northern States and Tamaulipas, that whole area of Bravo.

10:40.154 --> 10:43.579
And so when I identify with that, then

10:45.348 --> 11:00.743
I always looked at it from a maternal perspective, not like where my father's grandfathers were, but the grandmas, the mom, the grandma, great grandma, et cetera.

11:03.226 --> 11:14.697
And so that's how I made the connection to that we're, no matter whose blood came into the family line, we're still

11:15.031 --> 11:15.452
Native.

11:17.514 --> 11:21.320
So I never saw myself as a mestizo like that.

11:22.281 --> 11:29.050
Well, I guess, I mean, so that seems like maybe like a conscious kind of choice.

11:29.070 --> 11:29.992
Yeah.

11:30.012 --> 11:37.302
But would you maybe be aware if you like subconsciously thought about it or?

11:37.762 --> 11:42.709
No, I mean, the only time I ever thought about mestizo was that, hey, that's an interesting symbol.

11:44.798 --> 11:55.232
You know, artistically or graphically because it, it automatically tells you, oh, this is a combination of cultures.

11:56.473 --> 12:06.807
Um, but the more I discovered my cultural native stuff, you know, I've been calling, uh,

12:07.462 --> 12:13.831
and, you know, all kinds of words that I used growing up that weren't Mexican.

12:13.871 --> 12:14.512
I mean, Spanish.

12:14.933 --> 12:15.574
They were Mexican.

12:15.594 --> 12:17.577
They were Nahuatl or whatever.

12:19.379 --> 12:27.832
So it was a realization of the nativeness that's in us that we're just not even aware of.

12:30.275 --> 12:30.556
Okay.

12:31.838 --> 12:36.304
And then I met this guy with a teatro who's Israeli.

12:36.942 --> 12:41.469
who came with Peter Brook and they were with us for eight weeks.

12:41.489 --> 12:54.688
And this guy was, I don't know what the title or his focus was, but it had to do with physiology, the body.

12:56.070 --> 13:02.319
And he, what the hell did he tell me?

13:02.339 --> 13:06.105
What I learned from him was that he was saying that

13:07.334 --> 13:12.318
just by looking at a person, you can tell.

13:12.579 --> 13:14.500
Are you talking about the epidemiology?

13:14.820 --> 13:16.502
What's epidemiology?

13:16.522 --> 13:18.884
The, who was the guy you mentioned?

13:18.944 --> 13:19.364
Brooks?

13:19.885 --> 13:24.669
No, that was the guy who brought him, but his name was, uh, shit.

13:24.709 --> 13:25.710
I knew his name.

13:25.770 --> 13:33.697
His name was, I think epidemiology is like the, uh, actually, I don't know.

13:33.717 --> 13:36.379
He became a real, uh, he's a real famous guy.

13:37.237 --> 13:39.581
And his name will come to me at some point.

13:39.621 --> 13:50.279
But anyway, what he was doing is, you know how there's anthropologists and others who, by your skull formation or your teeth, they can tell.

13:50.699 --> 13:50.900
Yeah.

13:52.422 --> 13:53.203
Feldenkrais.

13:53.985 --> 13:54.866
That's his last name.

13:55.427 --> 13:56.629
What the hell was his first name?

13:57.993 --> 14:00.035
Feldenkrais, the Feldenkrais method.

14:00.355 --> 14:02.157
If you just put that, it'll come out.

14:02.177 --> 14:06.081
Anyway, he was in San Juan and he worked with us.

14:06.101 --> 14:18.412
But what he was saying is that human beings carry with them from generation to generation to generation to generation.

14:18.432 --> 14:19.493
In other words, you don't lose this.

14:22.756 --> 14:27.561
The body learns behavior and actions

14:28.317 --> 14:32.702
from your oldest ancestor.

14:33.863 --> 14:50.881
So what he was saying is he can look at a human being and the way they stand, their posture, the way they walk, all of that, and he can determine character, all kinds of different things about that.

14:51.501 --> 14:58.088
So anyway, he was there because he was trying to teach us about how to control the body,

14:58.726 --> 15:01.910
how to evolve it so that it's more balanced.

15:02.932 --> 15:09.300
So for example, like when you walk or stand with people, you always try to make yourself shorter.

15:10.201 --> 15:11.543
Do you know that?

15:11.563 --> 15:11.683
Me?

15:11.703 --> 15:11.903
Yeah.

15:12.344 --> 15:12.945
Personal?

15:12.985 --> 15:14.327
Personal.

15:14.347 --> 15:14.647
Oh, no, I know.

15:14.667 --> 15:16.169
You're always haunching, always doing that.

15:18.432 --> 15:22.197
And versus other people who stand taller or whatever.

15:22.578 --> 15:25.061
So anyway, why am I telling you all this?

15:25.081 --> 15:25.982
Just another...

15:26.958 --> 15:38.608
connection to, to why are we, or thinking in terms of consciousness, why are we the way we are?

15:38.628 --> 15:41.591
Why do we do what we do?

15:41.611 --> 15:56.644
Why are we, what are the character, what are the positive and the negative characteristics of raza and what significance is in your

15:57.113 --> 16:25.500
being because you're from Zacatecas or you're from Tamaulipas or you know from different areas so those were things that were interesting to me and so I always looked at that too and and all of that you know when you think about so what it led me to understand or to look seek out and stuff is why are we communal

16:26.273 --> 16:38.112
Why are we more communal as a lifestyle, as a way of being than gringos who are more selfish, more me first, you know, all of that stuff.

16:38.453 --> 16:53.057
Because those are the things that we need to understand about our way of being so that we can be it rather than, but like native people to show respect, they don't look

16:53.493 --> 17:14.556
you in the eye they don't they don't do this shit gringos do this shit and if you don't do that with a gringo they think you're less you have a problem whereas a native person he's being he or she's being respectful see what i'm saying so all that kind of stuff yeah

17:14.992 --> 17:16.433
I had an interest in.

17:16.834 --> 17:43.378
And so when I'd meet people, when I was working with people that weren't part of my family and I didn't know they weren't educated or they were educated, it didn't matter what their education was, that there was a way for me to connect with them in order to get a story out or a teatro acto or whatever, because that's how I

17:44.472 --> 17:47.295
built unity for action.

17:47.796 --> 17:48.196
Okay.

17:48.216 --> 17:49.998
Does that make any sense to you?

17:51.179 --> 17:51.800
Yeah.

17:51.820 --> 17:52.120
Okay.

17:52.140 --> 17:55.484
So it involves that as well.

17:56.084 --> 17:59.107
And then there's a whole spiritual side too.

18:00.849 --> 18:04.533
And that's been an involvement and development as well.

18:04.593 --> 18:12.842
I mean, the development and involvement of that as a Chicano is that for me, I had to come to the point where I'm saying,

18:13.987 --> 18:15.009
I'm not Catholic.

18:15.710 --> 18:19.756
Catholic is the ship that's been placed on me.

18:19.776 --> 18:23.142
La Virgen de Guadalupe is not La Virgen de Guadalupe.

18:24.284 --> 18:25.145
It's Mother Earth.

18:25.205 --> 18:31.055
It's a symbol no different than Guadalquia, the two-headed serpent.

18:32.096 --> 18:33.198
And so what does that mean?

18:33.218 --> 18:34.220
How do I explain that?

18:34.480 --> 18:35.742
Do I have to explain it?

18:35.883 --> 18:36.083
No.

18:37.365 --> 18:41.091
So when I went into that piece of Chicanismo,

18:41.560 --> 18:56.241
Then it becomes a whole other thing because you're really stepping on the oppressive colonial institutionalization of Christianity, Catholic Church on Native people.

18:57.983 --> 19:01.548
I mean, you still got your teacher, Gerardo and all these other people.

19:01.568 --> 19:05.053
They're so, you know, go to the church.

19:05.675 --> 19:33.133
yeah um well let's get back to the mestizaje stuff so um what were we just saying okay so you mentioned that so you you've never felt any kind of connection to well or at least to the idea that it is some kind of fusion of two cultures or how did you say it you said something about like a

19:33.923 --> 19:35.905
The image, the symbol.

19:36.005 --> 19:48.417
Yeah, I know, but you described it as a, like, culture clash, or not a culture clash, but like a combination or combining of cultures, something like that.

19:49.198 --> 19:49.378
Yeah.

19:49.778 --> 19:50.379
But anyways.

19:50.399 --> 20:03.171
It was another way of justifying that you weren't Spanish and you weren't Native, you were a combination of

20:03.488 --> 20:04.209
Yeah.

20:04.229 --> 20:21.133
Okay, so... And then you had mentioned that, like, when you saw the picture or the image that you thought, oh, okay, that's interesting, or that you had said that you were, like, suspect of it or suspicious of it.

20:21.895 --> 20:22.055
Mm-hmm.

20:22.075 --> 20:29.906
So I was wondering if you could tell me a little bit more, like, what was it that was... Like, why did it raise your suspicion?

20:30.928 --> 20:31.909
Well, because...

20:33.509 --> 21:00.981
Because, well, interestingly, I connect this to it now, but I didn't then, is that when I was about, when I was in training for my first communion, sitting in a Catholic church in the Barrio in McAllen, that there was an image of Our Lady of Guadalupe, a statue, and a statue of Mary on the other side.

21:01.942 --> 21:03.043
And I asked the

21:03.344 --> 21:06.349
the dumb question to the nurse, to the nun.

21:07.230 --> 21:08.793
She might as well be a nurse.

21:08.813 --> 21:10.916
To the nun, I said, how come there's two Marys?

21:11.698 --> 21:15.404
Why is there one that's brown and one that's blue-eyed and white?

21:16.446 --> 21:19.451
And her response was, don't be asking stupid questions.

21:19.471 --> 21:20.192
Give me your hand.

21:20.212 --> 21:22.536
And she hit me on my hand with a ruler.

21:23.177 --> 21:29.487
And I never forgot that since then because of

21:30.108 --> 21:36.016
the pain I felt on it and not understanding what the hell did I say or do.

21:36.837 --> 21:36.937
Yeah.

21:36.957 --> 21:57.966
And then later when I'm with a teatro in San Juan Batista and we're talking about doing a play that somebody sent us that was written by the Franciscans.

21:58.507 --> 21:58.647
Mm-hmm.

21:59.048 --> 22:07.536
the Espanoles, talking about the appearances, Las Cuatro Apariciones de la Virgen de Guadalupe.

22:08.177 --> 22:16.405
And so we thought, duh, hey, let's do this play because Cesar Chavez marches with the Virgen de Guadalupe.

22:16.425 --> 22:24.313
So he's using the cultural icons and images of our ancestors to create unity

22:24.631 --> 22:51.297
for labor organizing yeah so let's do a play about la virgen because our community is guadalupano part of it in in this concept and zapata carried her image in the in his hats and stuff and right so we're trying to make a connection of political action spiritual action and mexicanism with all of that and trying to

22:52.205 --> 22:55.129
to grasp it for a Chicano view of it.

22:55.970 --> 23:01.797
So we decided to do just the play as written by the priest.

23:01.817 --> 23:03.058
Luis wasn't even around.

23:03.078 --> 23:04.400
He didn't direct it or anything.

23:04.440 --> 23:08.745
It was me and Negro, Arturo Gomez, who lives in San Juan.

23:10.187 --> 23:11.548
And it was only four characters.

23:12.509 --> 23:19.418
Juan Diego, the bishop, the virgin, and the lowly priest.

23:22.081 --> 23:22.161
Wow.

23:22.462 --> 23:27.728
So it was very economical in that sense.

23:29.589 --> 23:49.110
So what happened with that is that while setting up to do that, I still got a goddamn book that I bought back then at a

23:49.529 --> 23:59.262
Mexican grocery store, you know, those little periodicals, which I read, and that was like my first background of the whole thing, right?

23:59.482 --> 24:10.097
And I began to question, you know, it's like, wait a minute.

24:10.117 --> 24:14.743
She appeared at the Temple of Do Not Seeing and da-da-da.

24:14.926 --> 24:21.173
that moment began to evolve my whole undoing of the Catholic line.

24:21.193 --> 24:21.413
Okay.

24:21.433 --> 24:21.974
And all of that.

24:23.196 --> 24:35.750
But in the process, it also connected me to a different piece, which had to do with faith based characteristic of native people.

24:37.152 --> 24:41.116
We don't have to necessarily see something to believe it.

24:42.538 --> 24:43.979
It's an internal sense.

24:44.080 --> 24:44.460
It's a,

24:45.301 --> 24:46.362
You know, it's a feeling.

24:48.485 --> 24:51.408
And I definitely had those feelings.

24:52.009 --> 24:54.652
I didn't know where they were from, but I knew I had them.

24:55.032 --> 25:03.442
But I immediately connected it to that fucking... Sister nun who hit me because I asked the question.

25:04.784 --> 25:09.229
And then I reviewed that question and I was still like, well, wait a minute.

25:09.249 --> 25:10.330
So how...

25:10.681 --> 25:24.322
So after all of these years, since 1971, which is when we did it, to now, I have evolved that question into she's Mother Earth.

25:24.442 --> 25:36.941
She's a representation of everything that Mother Earth represents, not just to Native people in Mexico, but Native people anywhere in the continent, okay?

25:38.624 --> 25:38.764
Mm-hmm.

25:39.352 --> 26:02.018
wait so do you think that the do you think that the image of Guadalupe is like do you think it was something that was fabricated by the Catholic Church or something that happened and was then used by the Catholic Church

26:04.040 --> 26:10.630
Something happened, something took place, and the Catholic Church has been exploiting it, appropriating it ever since.

26:11.230 --> 26:20.944
So as a Chicano who's evolved this whole story and all that, my stand right now is give back our artifacts.

26:20.964 --> 26:24.730
No different than the Native people who are, hey, that's our burial ground.

26:24.850 --> 26:28.215
Anything you find there is part of our ancestors.

26:28.235 --> 26:29.577
That's a part of our ancestors.

26:30.298 --> 26:30.558
Why?

26:30.618 --> 26:33.102
Because Juan Diego, a Native person,

26:33.773 --> 26:39.219
took care of it for the last remaining 50 years of his life, or whatever it was.

26:40.320 --> 26:51.391
And there's a location, and there's a factual element, the pilma.

26:52.472 --> 26:55.215
So that belongs to the native people of Mexico.

26:55.235 --> 26:58.438
It doesn't belong to the church, the pope, or any of that crap.

26:58.859 --> 27:02.903
That's being Chicano, to have those kind of demands.

27:03.811 --> 27:25.228
So do you think that, uh, I mean, so to kind of bring it back to the messy Sahih issue, do you think that the, cause we're kind of talking about like how the Catholic church most likely appropriated that image, um, that

27:27.436 --> 27:39.611
that that was part of, like, the Mestizah project to say, like, oh, look, she looks like you, but she's Catholic, or she's Christian, or something like that, right?

27:40.091 --> 27:40.792
She's married.

27:41.513 --> 27:41.894
Yeah.

27:41.914 --> 27:42.254
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

27:42.995 --> 27:57.072
You know, it's interesting, you know, the paper that I did about Sess of Chavez and stuff, I read that the Catholic Church did not fully integrate

27:57.440 --> 28:01.224
The Virgen until like 200 years later.

28:01.285 --> 28:04.889
Yeah.

28:07.131 --> 28:08.253
Yeah.

28:08.273 --> 28:11.897
Just like the... Yeah.

28:11.917 --> 28:22.049
Because... See, the whole cult of Guadalupe is people of faith.

28:22.069 --> 28:23.851
It was never the church promoting it.

28:24.271 --> 28:24.892
Yeah.

28:24.912 --> 28:25.573
And the...

28:25.874 --> 28:46.650
behavior of the catholic church has always been like that in other parts of the world they they go into a country and they eliminate everything that's stated in that country whether it's ireland or england or whatever germany and what they can't eradicate because it's such a strong faith based

28:46.748 --> 28:55.736
belief among the locals, then they say, okay, well, this is the same day of your person.

28:56.917 --> 28:58.478
And then they appropriate it.

28:58.558 --> 28:59.779
It's through appropriation.

29:01.300 --> 29:05.224
Dia de los puertos, All Saints Day, you know, just goes on and on and on.

29:05.844 --> 29:16.553
So what I'm saying is if you connect Tepeyac as property, as a place, a safer place,

29:17.427 --> 29:20.351
It doesn't belong to the Catholic Church.

29:20.371 --> 29:22.113
It doesn't belong to the Pope.

29:22.133 --> 29:30.284
It should be a demand of Native people to, what do you call it, to take it over?

29:30.665 --> 29:31.466
Reclaim it.

29:31.486 --> 29:32.367
Reclaim it.

29:32.387 --> 29:33.248
Yeah, exactly.

29:33.268 --> 29:37.614
That, to me, is the heart of Chicanismo.

29:37.634 --> 29:41.820
It's not getting a degree in biology or any of that other crap.

29:43.722 --> 29:44.363
Yeah.

29:45.625 --> 29:58.198
What do you, like, moving into the present, and I think you kind of touched upon this, but I think this will be my last kind of question.

30:00.241 --> 30:08.550
But how do you, do you see mestizaje ideas today?

30:09.010 --> 30:15.497
Are you familiar with, like, things that you might attribute to that

30:15.832 --> 30:45.670
messy side that idea of you know these two separate things becoming one no no I don't think so because what what I see is like let's just say in my lifetime in 68 years I've seen and let's say not even 68 years let's say 50 something or

30:46.122 --> 31:13.378
60 years no 50 something when I first came to California California was more population wise and all that was more California Lhasa sons grandsons of Mexicans okay first

31:14.506 --> 31:15.707
First, what do you call it?

31:15.727 --> 31:16.508
First generation.

31:17.609 --> 31:19.431
Now it's more Mexican.

31:20.412 --> 31:26.579
In other words, the Rocios and Macarios are the minority in terms of our community.

31:26.659 --> 31:27.700
They're more Mexican.

31:28.241 --> 31:44.158
There's more Rosas in the community because they've come into the community, but they're less conscious because they come with all the oppression and stuff that they left in Mexico.

31:44.628 --> 31:58.341
So you find yourself, you, your brother, not Matias, because Matias is more, he can, what do they call it?

31:58.782 --> 31:59.442
Navigate.

31:59.622 --> 32:01.905
He can navigate through that stuff.

32:02.605 --> 32:04.027
Just like I could navigate.

32:04.127 --> 32:10.833
I could navigate through the English, the Spanish, the Mexican, the whatever, and I still can.

32:10.853 --> 32:12.795
You guys are less able to do that.

32:13.062 --> 32:14.965
because there's more of that population.

32:15.005 --> 32:17.148
So they're not looking at themselves as Mestizos.

32:17.228 --> 32:23.016
They see themselves as Mexican, this and that, they're regional.

32:24.658 --> 32:31.728
But they are continuing to discover their native root.

32:33.810 --> 32:40.099
And they're gonna continue to do that until the rebellion

32:40.670 --> 32:41.311
Takes over.

32:41.351 --> 32:44.895
Cultural rebellion or physical rebellion.

32:45.596 --> 32:55.968
But it's going to be, it's not going to be, it'll only become military operation if somebody like Trump attacks Mexico.

32:55.988 --> 33:00.313
Then they'll come and get us, all of us, because they won't be able to tell the difference.

33:00.593 --> 33:02.596
Wait a minute, I got a nopal on my part now.

33:03.036 --> 33:04.958
A nopal.

33:04.978 --> 33:05.799
Kill you first?

33:05.819 --> 33:07.001
Yeah, well, that's identity.

33:07.061 --> 33:09.023
It's are you Mexican or not?

33:10.336 --> 33:29.340
And so Chicanismo has a responsibility here because when Mexicans come here and make a connection with Chicanos, there's two responses that take place.

33:29.742 --> 33:35.448
One is, these are the motherfuckers that are now oppressing us because they've taken the role of the gringo.

33:36.349 --> 33:37.250
They are the gringos.

33:38.231 --> 33:40.654
The Mexicans are saying that about the Chicanos?

33:41.114 --> 33:41.455
Yeah.

33:41.475 --> 33:46.500
Somebody like Macario, if they all work for him, he's like, hey, I'm the boss.

33:49.423 --> 33:54.149
Versus that there's a connection there.

33:55.670 --> 33:59.074
Which brings me to my latest

33:59.881 --> 34:29.753
evolvement of chicarismo which is saying to myself well now that i'm old and getting older it's about it's about somehow creating a way to so i see that it's still as important now than ever to continue to evolve the chicarismo perspective of

34:30.408 --> 34:34.914
of the Somos Uno, we're one, okay?

34:35.755 --> 34:55.059
And that those who have strayed away from the oneness are a part of, they can either become the sellouts, the traitors, the killers, the oppressors, the colonizers, da-da-da-da-da, versus those who are going to become closer to their root.

34:56.141 --> 34:59.385
And you see that happening right now all over.

35:01.306 --> 35:15.247
So, but do you see that as a... I see that as a natural process that the oppressive government is going to continue to use.

35:15.367 --> 35:17.190
That's why they want to get you in the army.

35:17.210 --> 35:19.473
They want to get you into this and that.

35:19.493 --> 35:25.141
Because when something really does happen, they're going to send your cousins after you.

35:28.086 --> 35:28.326
Yeah.

35:29.065 --> 35:39.037
And that's no different than what happened to the, let's say the Sioux, where they were put in reservations and then they hired the warriors to be the soldados.

35:39.057 --> 35:43.783
And then ultimately the ones who killed like crazy whores and some of the others.

35:43.863 --> 35:47.868
It's your own people.

35:47.888 --> 35:58.060
So do you think that the, like, do you see this as a consequence of that kind of idea of mestizaje that

35:59.052 --> 36:18.075
because there's this idea that we're mixed, that we can then somehow be part of both worlds, both American and... Mestizaje is... And this is the other thing I've been contemplating.

36:18.956 --> 36:27.186
Mestizaje is the expression or the backdrop of selling out.

36:27.942 --> 36:29.103
Becoming a vendido.

36:29.464 --> 36:30.365
Being a vendido.

36:30.445 --> 36:31.906
Existing is a vendido.

36:32.447 --> 36:34.489
So how do you make that connection?

36:35.050 --> 36:36.291
Or what do you mean by that?

36:36.331 --> 36:40.356
I mean, I think I know what you mean by that.

36:40.536 --> 36:42.138
What do you think I mean by that?

36:43.459 --> 36:47.123
Tell me that for a second.

36:47.143 --> 36:55.873
Well, I think what you're saying is that when you have kind of like this background or backdrop, as you called it,

36:56.613 --> 37:24.257
of mestizaje that gives you some kind of uh like a path to move between those two cultures those two ideas whatever they might be right and so yes if one of those cultures like going back to that story about that hopi man right and how they were saying that look the way that you you conquer

37:24.743 --> 37:28.828
or reclaim this stuff is by not becoming American, right?

37:28.848 --> 37:31.030
Or not adopting American values.

37:31.251 --> 37:31.811
Right.

37:31.831 --> 37:36.217
And so mestizaje gives you some kind of... Permission.

37:36.237 --> 37:44.927
Permission, or it opens a door that says, well, but that is part of your background, so it's okay for you to do that.

37:44.947 --> 37:47.590
Yeah, yeah.

37:47.610 --> 37:48.651
Is that a good way of it?

37:49.853 --> 37:51.935
Yeah, but I think I would... Did you not think of that?

37:52.115 --> 37:53.417
Yeah, but...

37:54.477 --> 38:19.084
but additionally that that it it releases the person or the individual from being responsible true to themselves yeah taking responsibility for themselves and i've always had that

38:19.604 --> 38:28.617
thrown back at me when I've asked an individual or a group or an organization to be true to the community.

38:28.717 --> 38:32.762
In other words, think of what's in the best interest of the community, not you.

38:34.024 --> 38:40.193
And their response is, well, if I don't take it, somebody else is going to take it.

38:40.213 --> 38:44.859
You know, it's a self-opportunist thinking.

38:45.580 --> 38:46.121
Vendido.

38:48.224 --> 38:48.885
And...

38:51.650 --> 39:04.626
I saw somewhere on Facebook that they were asking, somebody was asking, some university mecha grouper was inviting Luis to go and speak to them about this whole issue of... The mecha stuff?

39:04.646 --> 39:07.313
The mecha stuff.

39:07.968 --> 39:10.771
And you're thinking that's the wrong person to ask.

39:11.291 --> 39:19.819
And I'm thinking, you see, this is how ignorant most of the community is about what Luis Valdez represents.

39:20.299 --> 39:28.447
They see him as a... Someone who made it.

39:28.467 --> 39:30.328
Yeah.

39:30.348 --> 39:36.714
I was going to say a celebrity.

39:37.615 --> 39:37.755
Mm-hmm.

39:38.663 --> 39:59.693
And then because of his connection to the farm workers and labor movement, that he somehow has a, he has the qualifications to continue to be authentic.

40:01.195 --> 40:07.945
And they don't in any moment in the history from then to now look at his life and say,

40:08.195 --> 40:08.876
Oh, shit.

40:09.738 --> 40:19.414
In 1976, he wrote a play called Zoot Suit, where it's now an American play, not a Chicano play.

40:19.534 --> 40:20.676
It's an American play.

40:21.517 --> 40:23.300
Everything now is America.

40:23.320 --> 40:26.345
In other words, he's moved away from Chicano.

40:26.365 --> 40:30.232
He's promoting American.

40:31.454 --> 40:33.257
And it's all been...

40:33.592 --> 40:34.754
you know, that.

40:35.435 --> 40:55.330
So how in the hell are you going to get this guy who gave up his Chicano identity for an American identity in order to get the applause and the recognition from... But because he has that connection, that root connection to the farm workers, da-da-da-da, it blinds them

40:55.512 --> 40:57.875
to an involvement.

40:57.895 --> 41:00.659
So that's, so why do I have that view?

41:00.940 --> 41:03.243
I have that view because I've lived it.

41:03.703 --> 41:05.666
I've stood up against it, two.

41:06.347 --> 41:22.529
And three, it again gets back to the idea, well, why does the Raza Historical Society of San Jose invite Blanca Alvarado and these other yahoos to be the spokes panel for chicanismo?

41:23.651 --> 41:24.372
Fuck them.

41:24.993 --> 41:32.221
Yeah, I think about that, like, when I think about, like, Dolores Huerta, right?

41:32.241 --> 41:33.983
Like, I think she does that, too.

41:34.043 --> 41:38.327
She trades on that actual work that she did.

41:38.408 --> 41:51.282
And I think that's kind of what you're saying, too, about Luis, is that it's not to say that, like, they never were fully invested in that moment in time, but that they have changed.

41:51.362 --> 41:52.603
Something is...

41:52.870 --> 41:59.721
Well, yeah, but I mean, and that's fine to say, but that they like you have evolved.

41:59.781 --> 42:01.944
You went off a certain way.

42:02.465 --> 42:04.228
They went off this way.

42:04.248 --> 42:06.491
You're saying that path was the sellout way.

42:06.572 --> 42:07.193
That's fine.

42:07.753 --> 42:09.696
But that there has been a change.

42:09.777 --> 42:10.117
Right.

42:10.237 --> 42:13.883
But that people today fail to.

42:14.335 --> 42:17.219
Look at, contextualize it, right?

42:17.820 --> 42:25.971
And say, like, okay, they were doing this, but then in this time period, they were doing this other stuff, and then this happened, and then this other stuff happened, right?

42:26.692 --> 42:41.273
And I think about that, like, with Dolores Huerta, especially, like, you know, as she becomes more and more this, like, spokesperson for feminism and, like, white women feminism.

42:41.333 --> 42:41.473
Yeah.

42:41.740 --> 42:46.427
And, you know, the Democratic Party and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

42:47.368 --> 42:49.371
Yeah, exactly.

42:49.391 --> 42:51.915
Yeah, and so I think, I mean, I don't know.

42:53.858 --> 43:09.081
I think I want to go back to kind of like this point or if you have anything more you want to say about how you see Mestizaje as being kind of this blueprint to take that path forward.

43:09.601 --> 43:38.443
towards vendidos or vendidoism yeah I would say yes and because it's here's how I I don't know if it's justified but this is the perspective that

43:39.790 --> 43:42.233
that helps me identify what's true.

43:43.956 --> 43:53.989
And I learned this from those Native people in upstate New York, the St.

43:54.010 --> 43:56.333
Regis Retreat.

43:56.353 --> 44:08.970
One of the guys was saying that Native reality or philosophy is that you can't be one or the other

44:09.288 --> 44:10.890
You can't be mestizo.

44:11.030 --> 44:12.912
You can't be one or the other.

44:13.473 --> 44:14.734
You have to make a choice.

44:18.138 --> 44:38.400
And the reason that you have to make a choice is because the story that, or the philosophy that they follow is that when you're on the road, on the river of life, you cannot travel down that river of life with one leg in one canoe.

44:39.292 --> 44:41.434
and the other lake on another canoe.

44:41.614 --> 44:44.337
It can't be, you know, it can go either way.

44:45.298 --> 44:49.461
Because somewhere in that river of life, you're going to come to the rapids.

44:50.322 --> 44:54.126
And when you come to the rapids, you're going in.

44:54.146 --> 44:56.148
It's just as simple as that.

44:56.808 --> 45:01.753
You have to be, you have to make one choice.

45:01.773 --> 45:06.177
And those who are like that are going to,

45:08.553 --> 45:32.788
come apart it doesn't last so this reminds me of uh this uh it has to do with like nepanla right okay and somebody was describing it as like you're walking on kind of a like a you know like the top of a mountain or something um

45:33.190 --> 45:40.139
And that Nepantla kind of represents like trying to stay balanced on that very tip, right?

45:41.360 --> 45:44.103
Because if you go too much this way, you're going to fall in that.

45:44.123 --> 45:46.226
If you go too much this way, you're going to fall on the other side.

45:46.847 --> 45:55.297
But that it's this kind of like delicate balancing between falling on either side or instability, right?

45:55.778 --> 45:59.282
Even though it is surrounded by instability.

46:00.123 --> 46:14.982
So I'm wondering if you see any kind of like connection between that and... To me, that concept of the peak and the... In other words, you have to be in that constant balancing.

46:15.884 --> 46:18.167
That's what... This one's totally against that.

46:18.187 --> 46:18.567
Yeah.

46:18.587 --> 46:22.372
This one's saying you got to be one side of the fence.

46:22.612 --> 46:24.775
You can't be on both sides of the fence.

46:25.877 --> 46:26.097
And...

46:26.633 --> 46:34.602
And the Nepantla, I think the way that they're explaining it is not in that same context of one side or the next side for balance.

46:35.122 --> 46:53.923
I think that Nepantla story is more focusing on that in life, there is, the gringo word is, or let me see, the Mexican word,

46:56.114 --> 47:01.463
is that there's always change, there's always cambio going on.

47:02.945 --> 47:23.218
And in order for you to effectively deal with cambio, with change, you have to be ready for, what's the word?

47:26.945 --> 47:29.108
There's a word, but I can't think of it right now.

47:29.368 --> 47:36.617
But what it means is that you view change as something positive.

47:37.538 --> 47:53.276
You don't view it as something of balance, but rather it's about the skill of being able to be responsive to change.

47:53.297 --> 47:55.399
Not balance, but

47:57.016 --> 48:16.510
responsive so well i mean so maybe you could connect it to the the two legs and the boat story in the sense that because in in picking a side you are you're choosing right you're choosing to

48:17.063 --> 48:46.227
to to be more stable right given whichever way or how the river is flowing right um so instead of uh you know sticking with oh no i'm gonna keep my two feet in here no i'm gonna get rid of that one because this one and if it goes this way it's a little more stable and i can deal with that right now and then it might be that later you know you have to give up that little boat and jump on a log because the boat broke or whatever right

48:47.084 --> 48:54.694
But trying to... So maybe in that sense, like the equilibrium kind of comes back in.

48:55.195 --> 48:57.018
It's not about equilibrium.

48:57.038 --> 49:02.245
It's about... It's about being true.

49:02.966 --> 49:03.807
It's about being true.

49:04.808 --> 49:09.154
You can't... Well, why can't equilibrium be a part of being true?

49:09.174 --> 49:11.157
Because equilibrium has nothing to do with truth.

49:11.197 --> 49:13.160
Equilibrium has to do with balance.

49:14.702 --> 49:14.982
And...

49:15.637 --> 49:22.627
What being true is about is about being authentic.

49:22.647 --> 49:23.628
It's about being authentic.

49:23.689 --> 49:29.757
It's about sureness, not, you know, I have a choice.

49:30.859 --> 49:31.159
Yeah.

49:31.179 --> 49:32.081
There is no choice.

49:32.181 --> 49:33.402
It's only one way.

49:34.224 --> 49:35.065
You got to be true.

49:35.946 --> 49:40.092
That's why people who lie, that's why Native people don't lie.

49:40.553 --> 49:45.019
But you can choose to be untrue.

49:45.590 --> 49:45.930
Right?

49:47.652 --> 49:48.453
That's what you're saying.

49:48.473 --> 49:52.076
Those people who take that path towards vendidos.

49:53.337 --> 49:57.361
They know what the truth is.

49:57.381 --> 50:03.546
They choose to do that.

50:03.706 --> 50:10.072
They can come up with whatever theory or explanation to justify it.

50:10.172 --> 50:15.597
Maybe it's a commitment to truth or something like that.

50:18.530 --> 50:45.043
um well this is really fascinating but and this is the other thing chinganismo to me has evolved to be the thing about about being um that you can't you cannot choose to be dishonest you got to be honest that's the only thing that's pure

50:45.293 --> 50:48.658
Oh, so you're saying that's kind of like a principle of Chicanismo.

50:49.378 --> 50:49.479
Yeah.

50:49.499 --> 50:51.501
Yeah.

50:51.982 --> 50:52.202
Yes.

50:53.284 --> 50:53.865
Let me see.

50:53.925 --> 50:59.853
There was one more question I'm going to ask, and then we can go.

51:00.413 --> 51:12.730
Do you think that there is... Like, I liked all this kind of like, oh, I'm suspicious of mestizaje, that it gives you this excuse or past to be vendido.

51:14.272 --> 51:14.372
Yeah.

51:15.112 --> 51:22.219
Do you think it's possible for something where there is an authentic mestizaje?

51:24.005 --> 51:26.327
In the way that you were kind of talking about that.

51:26.387 --> 51:30.271
Do I think that there is a way to have authentic mestizaje?

51:30.451 --> 51:34.815
Or do you think that like, so here's what I'm kind of getting at.

51:34.835 --> 51:39.539
So in some mestizaje discourse, right?

51:39.559 --> 51:46.526
Like they always refer to there's mestizaje from above where you have people like Vasconcelos, right?

51:47.306 --> 51:53.312
Or some other kind of like Mexican intellectuals that say, or you can even say like from the Catholic church, right?

51:53.332 --> 51:53.472
Mm-hmm.

51:53.688 --> 51:56.493
Uh, you are two things.

51:57.134 --> 51:59.158
Uh, you're a combination of these two things.

51:59.338 --> 51:59.619
Right.

51:59.639 --> 52:00.340
And there you go.

52:00.380 --> 52:01.402
People have at it.

52:01.422 --> 52:02.444
Right.

52:02.464 --> 52:13.283
But is there, do you think that there is some kind of like messy sahih from below where it is like instantiated or, or made?

52:14.444 --> 52:41.869
made authentic because it's coming from the people and not coming from like institutions of of academia or the government or the church and i think maybe what i'm thinking of is like you know like raskwachi something like that but i don't know what do you think raskwachi no because raskwachi raskwachi

52:42.895 --> 52:45.859
Squatchiness is a technique.

52:46.240 --> 52:48.043
It's a learned technique.

52:52.870 --> 53:06.270
And it's at its best, I would say that it is a...

53:12.713 --> 53:20.561
But there's a genuine wisdom associated with Tosquatchitas.

53:22.362 --> 53:25.025
It's a, what do they call?

53:25.045 --> 53:28.869
It's an aesthetic.

53:28.889 --> 53:32.072
It's an aesthetic quality.

53:32.092 --> 53:36.216
You can't BS Tosquatchitas.

53:37.998 --> 53:38.638
People try.

53:38.999 --> 53:42.162
Yeah, well, it's clear to people that it isn't.

53:42.182 --> 53:42.282
Yeah.

53:42.599 --> 53:48.725
But it has to do with being able.

53:49.827 --> 54:08.286
It's like, you know how gringo society always, when they look at the native qualities and they have these perceptions of, oh, well, a native is like able to read nature.

54:08.890 --> 54:10.333
They can see tracks.

54:11.255 --> 54:14.541
The noble savage type of... Well, that's what they call it.

54:14.561 --> 54:29.269
But what I'm saying is that they identify within Native people that they have a quality that allows them to be able to be quiet, walk through the forest, read the forest.

54:29.850 --> 54:31.253
All of those skills...

54:32.414 --> 54:36.560
are rasquatchiness skills, is what I'm saying.

54:37.121 --> 54:46.454
A person who lives like that goes through life acting that out.

54:46.474 --> 54:50.399
Like your tÃ­o, he's out there working on the nopales or whatever the hell he's doing.

54:50.960 --> 55:01.375
He's got a lot of rasquatchy skills that he learned as a kid working with his grandfather out in the mountains with no tools, with no this, no that.

55:02.013 --> 55:04.816
And it's just innate.

55:04.836 --> 55:05.397
Is that the word?

55:06.138 --> 55:11.725
It's in him because it's, it's, it's, that's what it is.

55:11.745 --> 55:12.206
And so.

55:13.527 --> 55:24.160
But the Trasquatchee that you're talking about is like kind of like making, making use of something that it's like not intended for.

55:24.841 --> 55:26.163
Is that kind of what you do?

55:26.223 --> 55:27.885
Well, that's what, what.

55:29.114 --> 55:32.858
Academics say, but no, what I said is just what I just explained to you.

55:32.958 --> 55:45.192
It's an innate skill that you learned by being able to engage anything in the real world or the natural world.

55:45.212 --> 55:46.453
And adapt or something like that.

55:46.473 --> 55:49.096
And use it.

55:49.116 --> 55:49.436
Okay?

55:50.938 --> 55:52.560
What was I watching the other day?

55:53.921 --> 55:54.262
I don't know.

55:54.842 --> 55:57.265
Oh, you know how they have those videos where they show

55:57.599 --> 56:03.848
these islanders, and they're like, they gather one little stick, and they end up making a pool.

56:04.388 --> 56:06.271
You know what I'm talking about?

56:06.571 --> 56:06.671
Yeah.

56:06.912 --> 56:07.793
Yeah, it's like that.

56:07.853 --> 56:10.477
That's rasquatchy skill.

56:12.459 --> 56:22.473
You know, you can't, you could probably teach that in the academic world, but this guy just doesn't.

56:22.493 --> 56:24.636
They use their environment,

56:28.109 --> 56:30.853
And it functions.

56:32.435 --> 56:33.396
Functionality.

56:35.259 --> 56:38.423
Genuine.

56:38.443 --> 56:40.706
And Mexicans have that skill.

56:42.048 --> 56:42.689
They just have it.

56:42.709 --> 56:51.942
That's why when you hear George Lopez making his comedy, he says, oh, man, if they build a wall, we'll figure out how to use it for something positive.

56:52.883 --> 56:53.424
It is true.

56:54.746 --> 56:54.986
You know?

56:55.387 --> 56:57.930
But so would you... Oh, so they showed...

56:58.332 --> 57:04.199
this one video they were showing this family who had all this nice barbed wire on their property.

57:04.740 --> 57:05.321
They took it off.

57:05.341 --> 57:10.327
They took it off the wall?

57:10.347 --> 57:11.609
Off the wall.

57:11.629 --> 57:12.430
Oh, I see.

57:12.450 --> 57:17.657
It's like, it's serving no purpose here, let's put it over here.

57:18.358 --> 57:18.618
Yeah.

57:19.559 --> 57:28.170
Well, so would you, would you consider that to be something different than Miss Isaheus?

57:30.243 --> 57:41.781
I think mestizaje is propagated or promotion is from the church because they want to continue.

57:42.702 --> 57:54.580
I mean, they had a political battle with Spain, with the government, with the monarchy, because they wanted the native people

57:54.931 --> 58:00.939
to be their slaves in their missions and churches so they could use them and exploit them.

58:00.959 --> 58:03.963
Whereas the EspaÃ±ol was like, shit, let's get rid of them.

58:04.464 --> 58:10.833
You know, all their good is for... Their land?

58:10.853 --> 58:14.117
Yeah, for their land, their gold, their silver, and their labor.

58:15.519 --> 58:23.250
The churches wanted them for their labor, but they also wanted them inside the church because they saw that.

58:23.990 --> 58:32.000
Plus, that's how they kept all their priests fat, you know, and sexually content or whatever the hell.

58:32.020 --> 58:52.885
So it was in the church's best interest, also politically, that what was happening right at that moment in history when the EspaÃ±oles came to Mexico, that Martin Luther had left the church and started the Protestant movement in Germany.

58:53.306 --> 58:53.406
Yeah.

58:53.943 --> 59:03.841
So they lost half of their Catholics, and they gained Catholics by enslaving the native.

59:04.121 --> 59:12.536
Well, I think that's all I have to ask.

59:12.736 --> 59:15.882
Is there anything you want to finish up with?

59:15.902 --> 59:16.002
Yes.

59:16.437 --> 59:17.419
Turn it off for a second.

59:17.559 --> 59:18.400
Let me find it.

59:19.061 --> 59:20.103
Are you going to play a song?

59:20.664 --> 59:22.026
No, I have a thing.

59:22.106 --> 59:29.878
Led to believe by Luis Valdez of El Teatro Campesino that we were the Chicano Cultural Liberation Front of the Chicano Movement.

59:30.739 --> 59:32.582
That our role of, are you recording?

59:33.243 --> 59:33.343
Yeah.

59:33.363 --> 59:39.834
That our role of resistance and rebellion was through the use of our cultural voice and activism.

59:39.854 --> 59:43.980
Through teatro, our cultural history is a weapon against the

59:44.247 --> 59:51.519
Anglo growers, white institutions, the Catholic Church, the war in Vietnam, white colonial oppression, etc.

59:52.120 --> 59:56.988
We were a Chicano propaganda arm of the Chicano movement.

59:57.008 --> 01:00:09.850
I was engaged in this cultural organization for seven years from 1969 to 1976 as a Chicano cultural activist, as an activist committed to our Chicano movement, La Causa.

01:00:10.268 --> 01:00:39.289
Our mutual ideals united us to do this as an independent band of individuals, rebels with no pay or tribute to create a way of life through self-reliance, Chicano self-determination to become, to build a Centro Capesino Cultural de Aslan, a Chicano propaganda production center that would be a hub for reaching Chicanos and la raza throughout the U.S.

01:00:39.369 --> 01:00:40.090
and Mexico.

01:00:41.015 --> 01:00:55.656
I am a descendant of the native people of this continent.

01:00:55.676 --> 01:01:02.185
Descendant from the native people of Aslan, whose ancestral lands are continental in scope.

01:01:02.746 --> 01:01:08.895
I no longer recognize the term America as a true name of these lands or continents.

01:01:09.314 --> 01:01:16.664
whose European occupiers landed in 1492, a mere 526 years ago.

01:01:16.684 --> 01:01:20.709
I no longer accept Christianity as my religious way of life.

01:01:21.230 --> 01:01:28.740
I now understand that my religious and spiritual ways were destroyed by the Vatican and the Roman Catholic Church.

01:01:29.108 --> 01:01:34.914
and all of its agents, Western European monarchs and Christian sects.

01:01:35.735 --> 01:01:41.961
I no longer recognize Columbus as the discoverer of these lands and these continents.

01:01:41.981 --> 01:01:53.512
I no longer accept the identity of Indian, which was forced on all native people of these lands and continent by colonial legacy of Christopher Columbus.

01:01:55.214 --> 01:01:59.098
I choose to identify and call myself a Chicano

01:02:00.074 --> 01:02:11.634
I live to restore within me my true sense of being that resides deep in the genetic memory makeup of my ancestral native people.

01:02:12.416 --> 01:02:17.104
I live to honor and restore my ancestral people worldview.

01:02:17.911 --> 01:02:21.176
I live to be a warrior for life in this cause.

01:02:21.757 --> 01:02:29.429
I live to restore all that was stolen in the name of Western people's governments and religion.

01:02:29.449 --> 01:02:39.044
I live to expose the lives and thievery of Western people and their descendants who benefit today from their evil actions.

01:02:39.064 --> 01:02:43.210
For those who still say that was not them, not I,

01:02:44.388 --> 01:02:50.816
I live to always speak truthfully and to seek justice for all Native people and their descendants.

01:02:51.437 --> 01:02:56.663
I believe in Native people wisdom and their view of social justice for all people.

01:02:57.324 --> 01:03:06.615
I live to honor and respect Mother Earth as our universal home that shelters and feeds all living organisms.

01:03:07.336 --> 01:03:12.522
I understand that all life is precious and that we live only a short time on this earth.

01:03:13.126 --> 01:03:24.454
that our primary responsibility is to leave this earth better than we found it for our grandchildren, to dismantling of the doctrine of discovery.

01:03:26.358 --> 01:03:27.501
And I think that's where I stopped.

01:03:28.865 --> 01:03:31.090
Anyway, it goes on and on.

01:03:31.110 --> 01:03:31.772
All right.

01:03:31.792 --> 01:03:32.333
Thank you.
