WEBVTT

00:00.841 --> 00:06.510
Okay, so we are here with Armando Rendon.

00:06.530 --> 00:09.815
Did you go by Dr. Rendon or just Armando?

00:10.276 --> 00:12.519
No, I got a JD, but I don't.

00:12.539 --> 00:12.980
Oh, okay.

00:13.040 --> 00:14.702
It doesn't matter.

00:14.722 --> 00:15.043
All right.

00:15.163 --> 00:18.248
Well, so today's September 6th.

00:20.612 --> 00:23.095
Let's start off with your name and age.

00:24.277 --> 00:25.199
Armando Rendon.

00:26.180 --> 00:27.422
I'm 80 years old.

00:27.773 --> 00:51.503
born in 1939 1939 wow um they're still around well i'm not just that but i'm considering like most of the people that i've interviewed are born in the 40s uh i or you know really early 50s so this will be a good opportunity to get kind of a a

00:51.787 --> 00:58.417
Well, not that you're not part of that generation, but a little bit older than most of the people.

01:01.100 --> 01:07.289
And so you had mentioned a little bit earlier, you were born in Texas, in San Antonio.

01:07.309 --> 01:13.038
Can you tell me a little bit more about kind of your, where you were born and raised, what that was maybe like?

01:13.198 --> 01:18.085
I was born in the West Side Barrio, it's called the West Side in San Antonio.

01:20.829 --> 01:21.490
And I was

01:21.875 --> 01:36.997
basically raised in the house that my grandfather built and was raised pretty much by my grandmother and my mother and had five uncles and two aunts.

01:38.600 --> 01:41.203
So they all took part in raising me.

01:44.628 --> 01:47.713
The house, in fact, was built by my grandfather.

01:48.605 --> 01:53.992
He was a Kickapoo Indian, full-blooded.

01:56.074 --> 02:04.765
And my grandmother was from a place called Abasolo in Coahuila, which is right next to Texas.

02:06.667 --> 02:11.493
And somehow they met way back then.

02:12.995 --> 02:16.519
They crossed the border, in fact, in 1903.

02:17.967 --> 02:21.413
I already had my oldest aunt, Romana.

02:21.653 --> 02:26.341
She was already, I guess, just a little kid, maybe even a baby still.

02:27.964 --> 02:35.436
I moved into with my grandmother's father who was living in San Antonio.

02:36.293 --> 02:37.775
I assume it was in the west side.

02:39.538 --> 02:44.526
Most Mexicans that came in from cross-border would settle in the west side.

02:44.566 --> 02:48.772
It was kind of the closest to the border, about 150 miles closer.

02:48.792 --> 02:54.641
And the north side, and of course the north side was predominantly Anglo.

02:55.623 --> 02:57.205
That's the way it was.

02:57.893 --> 03:06.223
So for this project of my oral history, I really kind of have two main questions.

03:06.323 --> 03:19.058
So the first main question is whether or not whether, but how do you see yourself as a participant of the Chicano movement?

03:19.375 --> 03:23.842
Or do you consider yourself a participant of the Chicano movement?

03:23.862 --> 03:27.808
Yes, I'm very much so in a couple ways.

03:30.212 --> 03:35.821
One is someone who promoted the movement.

03:36.402 --> 03:37.243
I wrote about it.

03:37.424 --> 03:41.991
I took part in some phases of it.

03:42.427 --> 03:48.962
especially the, being in California, the great boycott.

03:49.062 --> 03:53.232
I met Cesar Chavez about 1964.

03:56.299 --> 03:58.444
He recruited me, among others,

04:05.630 --> 04:17.575
which I did by helping organizing or in helping organize protests when the boycott started, got involved with that and so forth.

04:18.918 --> 04:25.933
I also was, I think, a participant as an observer, which

04:26.285 --> 04:35.601
It was actually my career goal to become a journalist, which I did.

04:35.661 --> 04:43.975
My first job was as a reporter for a weekly newspaper in Sacramento.

04:43.995 --> 04:50.807
And one of the reasons that I ended up there with my family, because my wife and I married in 61,

04:52.036 --> 04:54.920
and moved up there toward the end of 61.

04:56.662 --> 04:59.566
And I began working for this newspaper.

04:59.586 --> 05:00.768
It's called the Catholic Herald.

05:01.429 --> 05:03.952
It was a diocesan newspaper.

05:04.012 --> 05:10.481
And I was actually their only full-time reporter.

05:12.023 --> 05:14.206
I actually went out and got stories and that sort of thing.

05:16.990 --> 05:18.752
That was my first job in journalism.

05:20.723 --> 05:31.313
In fact, that's how I met Cesar Chavez, because I heard about this fellow coming up to Sacramento, and I thought I'd do a story on him, what he was doing.

05:32.154 --> 05:36.498
He just sucked me right in.

05:37.799 --> 05:39.060
I realized he was a real thing.

05:43.744 --> 05:49.009
But I began to take notes and do stories.

05:49.681 --> 06:04.135
I got involved in actually, this was about 1964-65 that I helped organize and started an organization called REAP.

06:06.097 --> 06:07.999
R-E-A-P.

06:08.059 --> 06:11.462
Rural Education and Advancement Program.

06:13.564 --> 06:17.848
And this was the time of the war in poverty.

06:18.689 --> 06:19.691
which you wouldn't remember.

06:20.653 --> 06:22.937
You might have heard of it.

06:24.039 --> 06:34.959
There were some monies being given out for different projects like that, but it was mostly funded by the diocese of Sacramento, Catholic diocese.

06:34.979 --> 06:42.132
And in fact, my wife and I, we had, I think we had at least two kids by then.

06:43.664 --> 06:44.986
Yeah.

06:45.006 --> 06:52.616
We spent a summer in a little town called Hood, which is near the river.

06:52.656 --> 06:57.282
It's down by some of the other towns.

06:57.302 --> 07:04.011
Maybe it's like 15, 20 miles down the Sacramento River where there's all kinds of little towns along there.

07:05.573 --> 07:13.283
And it's populated mostly by probably, I think, settled out Mexicans, African-Americans from the migrant stream.

07:13.752 --> 07:15.815
Is that north of Sacramento?

07:15.895 --> 07:16.256
South.

07:16.276 --> 07:16.677
Oh, south.

07:16.697 --> 07:16.797
Okay.

07:16.817 --> 07:17.298
It's below it.

07:17.959 --> 07:19.461
Still in Sacramento County.

07:22.045 --> 07:33.263
And we work with other people in the city and so forth to bring up services like, you know, kids program, teaching kids little things, you know.

07:33.766 --> 07:39.012
having programs for the mothers and the fathers and, you know, that sort of thing.

07:39.032 --> 07:40.554
It was just a lot of fun.

07:44.278 --> 07:48.784
And thank goodness my wife, you know, agreed to do it.

07:48.804 --> 07:53.569
Because we actually moved our household down there and found a little place to stay.

07:54.771 --> 08:02.760
But, so yeah, I think all of that, you know, went into...

08:04.630 --> 08:13.783
into my mind, you might say my brain and memory as observations, which a reporter is trained to do, you know.

08:14.925 --> 08:21.795
So that was my, that's why I say I think I was both an observer and a participant.

08:23.377 --> 08:27.904
So observer in your kind of capacity as a journalist,

08:28.846 --> 08:32.852
and a participant in your capacity of organizing.

08:35.336 --> 08:40.984
Can I ask you about your meeting with Cesar Chavez?

08:41.485 --> 08:55.967
What was it about that meeting that then led you on this path to be more involved and want to do more observing of the movement itself?

08:57.314 --> 08:59.317
Well, he had something about him.

09:00.038 --> 09:01.139
People call it charisma.

09:03.923 --> 09:09.269
I felt that he was really an honest person.

09:10.531 --> 09:24.249
And he was certainly talking about issues that I sort of knew about, but I hadn't really got involved with in terms of farm labor issues and treatment of migrant workers and that sort of thing.

09:24.870 --> 09:25.971
I had done a little bit of

09:26.778 --> 09:31.847
research because of my job, but I hadn't really gotten into it before that.

09:31.907 --> 09:46.554
So, obviously I did more, I don't think I did that many more stories, but I started writing about it and it influenced my perspective on the world, let's put it that way.

09:48.518 --> 09:50.862
Having met Sasar and

09:51.685 --> 09:54.329
I knew him over the years until, you know, his death.

09:56.653 --> 10:00.359
He was definitely an influence on me, as he was for many people, you know.

10:02.964 --> 10:08.513
So that meeting, and it was, I think he basically had come up

10:09.438 --> 10:22.789
to meet with contacts that he had in Sacramento or the people that were involved, like down in Delano, in that area, were aware of up here.

10:23.073 --> 10:25.837
I don't know if he had ever gotten up here before that as such.

10:26.017 --> 10:35.108
He might have done so because his family was migrant, so they might have come all the way to Sacramento and picked tomatoes or whatever.

10:36.830 --> 10:49.907
I remember, in fact, doing a story about the harvesters, and I'll never forget seeing one of the worker's hands

10:50.528 --> 10:56.536
And most of them, you know, green from the pesticides and the tomatoes all mixing in, you know.

11:00.400 --> 11:04.205
Yeah, just things like that and the kind of places they lived in.

11:06.708 --> 11:07.649
Shacks, you know.

11:08.250 --> 11:14.358
I mean, you wouldn't put a, nowadays, you know, you wouldn't think of putting a dog in, something like that.

11:14.378 --> 11:14.498
Right.

11:14.518 --> 11:16.821
You had families living in these places, you know.

11:16.841 --> 11:16.941
Yeah.

11:17.326 --> 11:23.185
So this was something that you were experiencing before your encounter with

11:23.435 --> 11:26.719
Yeah, I knew someone who had been living in Sacramento County.

11:27.701 --> 11:41.779
And, you know, being part of other efforts that had been made, or not actually had been made, but there was a recognition of, like, the Catholic Church to go out and help migrant workers and their families.

11:41.799 --> 11:43.020
So I did that.

11:46.164 --> 11:50.590
But it all just, what's the word, informed, you know,

11:55.514 --> 12:09.396
Yeah, well, I was just going to ask a clarifying question about, because it sounds like you're working a lot with the Catholic Church.

12:09.536 --> 12:23.158
So was it that kind of being part of that community, the church community that then kind of exposed you to, okay, here's what's going on with these laborers.

12:23.577 --> 12:33.245
And now I've got this job with the Catholic Herald, and there's this other stuff going on down in Delano, and I'm going to go check that out.

12:33.526 --> 12:53.483
Is that how it... Well, actually, it actually goes back a little bit farther back in that when I went to Sacramento to work for that job, the idea of the editor, Amard Gallagher,

12:54.003 --> 13:03.862
He had gotten some money, you know, some funding from the Archdiocese to hire somebody to actually do stories.

13:05.144 --> 13:17.007
Because before that, they were mostly doing, you know, social stuff and sports events going on in the church, you know, like.

13:17.813 --> 13:21.101
holidays or holy days would come up and they'd have stories about that.

13:22.484 --> 13:34.091
So because of my background, I had been in, when I was in college, going back to high school, I always worked on the high school or the college paper.

13:34.552 --> 13:34.692
Mm-hmm.

13:35.431 --> 13:41.238
I was editor of the Collegian, which was the St.

13:41.258 --> 13:44.422
Mary's College newspaper as a junior.

13:45.984 --> 13:48.066
And so, which was a little early.

13:48.127 --> 13:50.269
Usually it was a senior that got the job.

13:51.330 --> 14:00.021
But yeah, I've been so closely involved that when it came open,

14:00.845 --> 14:05.271
our advisor asked me if I would be the editor.

14:05.311 --> 14:08.034
I said, sure, you know.

14:08.054 --> 14:25.057
So I'd been, you know, doing story even when I was in high school and so forth that were different than just social events or sports or the food is bad on the campus, that sort of thing.

14:26.639 --> 14:29.282
So I think Amar hired me

14:30.157 --> 14:34.406
specifically to go out and do some stories to, you know, get something, some of the issues.

14:34.627 --> 14:37.954
And the Vatican too was, you know, in the works at that time.

14:38.014 --> 14:39.197
So it was all these things going on.

14:40.540 --> 14:48.958
And I was happy as, you know, as it can be because I had the whole,

14:53.343 --> 15:07.022
And I did stories on the prisons, I did stories on the mental institutions, the stories on autism.

15:07.042 --> 15:08.466
I remember doing a story on

15:08.969 --> 15:10.551
football helmets, you know?

15:10.571 --> 15:14.154
I mean, anything that came along, I was interested in alcoholism.

15:14.314 --> 15:20.961
I didn't always... But one time, there was a... I heard about a cursillo.

15:21.982 --> 15:23.803
Do you remember cursillos de cristiandad?

15:25.565 --> 15:26.506
Okay.

15:26.526 --> 15:27.967
Cursillos.

15:27.987 --> 15:31.871
Cursillos, like little courses, little cursillos.

15:32.872 --> 15:35.955
And it was a movement that started in Spain.

15:37.437 --> 15:45.731
What it was, it was about two or three days of really intense interaction among men.

15:45.811 --> 15:48.936
It started among men, but then women got into it.

15:50.299 --> 15:55.367
You know, the church relented or something, they said, oh yeah, we'll do it for women too.

15:57.491 --> 15:59.534
You know, we're talking about the early 60s, of course.

16:01.598 --> 16:03.681
I won't say it very much has changed, but at any rate,

16:03.982 --> 16:13.013
And so the Curcios were intended to sort of revive Catholicism among the poor.

16:13.033 --> 16:27.711
I think they were distinctly, I recognize distinctly that they are intended for anybody, but certainly the poor and the less educated

16:28.282 --> 16:33.771
people that needed more, like, greater knowledge about the Catholicism, for one thing.

16:36.296 --> 16:44.870
It was certainly aimed at them, but I heard about it, and it sounded like a story, you know?

16:46.333 --> 16:49.598
So in order to cover the story, I attended one of these corsios, and I had a...

16:50.017 --> 16:51.059
a lot of impact on me.

16:53.243 --> 16:58.894
So that's where this thing about observer and participant sort of really get mixed up, right?

17:01.078 --> 17:07.030
But it made my Catholicism much more active, is one thing.

17:07.010 --> 17:24.576
And that's another source of influence, you might say, that, again, sort of molded my future activities, you know.

17:26.459 --> 17:34.030
So when my wife went to Corsillo and all that, so when they, obviously when the idea of, which I,

17:34.010 --> 17:37.275
I basically came up with the idea of having the summer program.

17:38.577 --> 17:42.342
We were both very much committed to that kind of stuff anyway.

17:43.624 --> 17:45.046
We got other people involved.

17:45.066 --> 17:59.428
In fact, even this young woman who had been a babysitter for our kids since we had our first child in Sacramento, she got involved.

17:59.628 --> 18:00.549
She's still in the front.

18:00.630 --> 18:02.312
We talked for her.

18:02.900 --> 18:04.122
An hour or two every now and then.

18:05.183 --> 18:08.627
But she lives in Washington State.

18:11.291 --> 18:16.517
So are these curcillos, are they kind of like evangelist types of mediums?

18:16.738 --> 18:19.081
Well, I don't know if you want to put it that way.

18:19.101 --> 18:25.549
I think they're an intense short course in Catholicism, you know.

18:26.137 --> 18:29.982
Like different teachings, different readings, things like that.

18:30.002 --> 18:32.946
Right, the men themselves become involved in it.

18:32.966 --> 18:36.991
So they become roistas, that was the term.

18:37.251 --> 18:40.776
Royos is a phrase for like a presentation.

18:43.038 --> 18:50.608
Sort of like maybe a sort of thing of a homily or something to activate.

18:53.288 --> 18:56.463
I did some of those.

18:58.714 --> 19:00.362
Like you were leading those?

19:01.017 --> 19:03.299
Well, I became one of the organizers.

19:03.599 --> 19:05.361
I would help organize them.

19:05.381 --> 19:08.404
And I would present Arroyo once in a while.

19:10.085 --> 19:11.887
So, yeah, I became very much involved.

19:11.907 --> 19:17.132
And I think as far as my Catholicism, it had a big impact.

19:17.152 --> 19:20.855
But I've written about this in, in fact, Chicano Manifesto.

19:20.895 --> 19:31.024
It really put me in touch with my own people.

19:31.004 --> 19:40.819
for like maybe the previous 10 years or so, I hadn't really spoken much Spanish, for one thing.

19:41.480 --> 19:47.249
I got away from it, moving from San Antonio to Oakland, California, and then San Leandro.

19:49.933 --> 19:52.337
It wasn't like it is now, let me put it that way.

19:53.259 --> 19:54.801
So I

19:58.004 --> 20:08.301
I get some royals in Spanish, and I had to deal with these guys who were, you know, they'd been braceros, they were, you know,

20:09.260 --> 20:11.122
definitely blue-collar types, you know.

20:14.405 --> 20:16.707
But, you know, the phrase, salt of the earth.

20:18.168 --> 20:33.482
So, yeah, so it's kind of like, I shouldn't use the word, barriers, but just certainly, you know, lack of contact with my own people, so to speak, you know.

20:34.623 --> 20:36.685
So they had that influence also.

20:37.492 --> 21:02.368
So what was, it sounds like you're saying that when you went out there and started attending or going to these that you had, that it somehow kind of brought you together with your own community, right?

21:02.388 --> 21:06.233
And so I guess maybe my question would be

21:07.647 --> 21:16.371
What was it about, like, so what brought you from San Antonio to the Bay Area that there was a moment where you were disconnected?

21:16.732 --> 21:17.916
Exactly.

21:19.219 --> 21:21.746
Because I spent the first 10 years in San Antonio.

21:22.208 --> 21:22.348
Mm-hmm.

21:23.712 --> 21:25.594
And Spanish was my first language.

21:27.195 --> 21:36.723
I think I started to learn it when I was pretty young because all my uncles and aunts and my mother were pretty fluent, you know.

21:38.145 --> 21:48.674
I think all of them had completed high school, so they had some grounding educationally.

21:49.554 --> 21:53.618
But the only person at that time who would

21:54.003 --> 21:59.470
going beyond high school was my aunt, one of my aunts who became a nun.

21:59.490 --> 22:02.775
She took college courses and that sort of thing.

22:02.795 --> 22:07.782
I was probably the second in the family who actually went to college and completed college.

22:10.525 --> 22:23.503
But when I left San Antonio, yeah, I moved here and there was hardly anybody to talk to in the school I went to, the parochial school.

22:24.226 --> 22:32.457
There were like four, maybe three or four Mexican kids too, Mexican-American kids, including myself.

22:33.499 --> 22:36.723
So, and you didn't really talk, you know, in school.

22:37.103 --> 22:43.072
I mean, I came from San Antonio, from Texas, where you weren't supposed to talk, you know, on school grounds, right?

22:43.092 --> 22:44.233
You get punished and whatnot.

22:45.174 --> 22:51.583
So, I had that, you know, to deal with, but also...

22:51.918 --> 22:53.280
It wasn't taught in school.

22:53.420 --> 22:56.023
None of the teachers were bilingual.

22:56.965 --> 22:57.525
So, yeah.

22:57.746 --> 23:07.038
And then my mother, she tried to keep me speaking Spanish, but got to the point where she would speak to me in Spanish and I would respond in English.

23:07.619 --> 23:12.926
So I knew what she was telling me, but I was embarrassed or just not comfortable or whatever.

23:15.169 --> 23:21.317
So I lost any real fluency that I should have had if I had kept it up.

23:21.365 --> 23:23.327
And that was here in the Bay Area?

23:23.347 --> 23:23.987
Right, right.

23:24.348 --> 23:28.531
So how did, what brought your family over here from?

23:28.551 --> 23:29.352
It was just my mother.

23:29.492 --> 23:32.775
She moved out here during, it's a long story, long family story.

23:33.495 --> 23:37.579
But she moved out here during World War II.

23:39.000 --> 23:41.122
It was probably two by then.

23:42.423 --> 23:47.387
She came out here and worked in the industry, in the military industry, or what do you call it, the war industry.

23:47.587 --> 23:49.009
Yeah.

23:49.029 --> 23:50.730
She assembled parachutes.

23:51.352 --> 23:52.213
down in Alameda.

23:52.253 --> 23:55.757
They had, you know, the naval place down there.

23:58.921 --> 24:03.846
Her favorite line was that, because, you know, she packed parachutes, right?

24:03.866 --> 24:06.329
She said, I never got a complaint from anybody.

24:10.094 --> 24:14.318
You know, kind of droll of humor.

24:14.338 --> 24:18.603
Yeah, but that's kind of the first job she got when she moved out here.

24:18.924 --> 24:20.025
It was a lot of...

24:20.680 --> 24:24.284
personal story behind that.

24:25.385 --> 24:34.454
Suffice to say that by the time I was 10, she'd been, you know, trying to get a job and find a nice place to live and all that sort of thing.

24:35.335 --> 24:41.461
So finally, by the time I was 10, she felt like she wanted me to come out and join her.

24:42.102 --> 24:44.104
So that's how I ended up coming out here.

24:45.485 --> 24:50.130
And I was about, I started, I think I started fifth grade here.

24:50.633 --> 24:56.420
So I was, what, 10 years old.

24:56.721 --> 24:58.202
You said you went to St.

24:58.242 --> 24:59.664
Mary's College?

24:59.684 --> 25:00.045
I went to St.

25:00.065 --> 25:00.745
Mary's College.

25:00.966 --> 25:01.566
That's the St.

25:01.587 --> 25:02.267
Mary's here.

25:02.428 --> 25:02.848
Moraga.

25:03.068 --> 25:04.150
Yeah, yeah, okay.

25:04.290 --> 25:04.790
I went to St.

25:04.810 --> 25:05.772
Mary's High School, too.

25:05.932 --> 25:06.553
There's a St.

25:06.593 --> 25:08.415
Mary's in San Antonio, right?

25:08.435 --> 25:09.436
Sure, it's a St.

25:09.476 --> 25:10.277
Mary's University.

25:10.518 --> 25:11.158
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

25:11.899 --> 25:14.603
Okay, yeah, I just wanted to be clear on that.

25:15.404 --> 25:17.346
Okay, so that's really interesting.

25:18.007 --> 25:18.227
Yeah.

25:20.182 --> 25:44.012
when you were talking about uh the the stories that you were interested in covering as a journalist right um it sounded kind of like like what would you say was the theme of those stories to me like i hear what you're saying and i think the theme is like some kind of social justice there's some social

25:44.482 --> 25:50.892
social justice aspect to each of these stories that you're trying to investigate?

25:50.932 --> 25:53.877
Yeah, no, I think that's what was driving me.

25:53.937 --> 25:56.962
Like I say, my education at St.

25:56.982 --> 25:59.867
Mary's was definitely formative in that regard.

26:01.510 --> 26:09.763
I was in a program which had started just a year before I got into it, which was based on the great books.

26:10.823 --> 26:15.948
the curriculum basically that started at University of Chicago.

26:19.211 --> 26:19.651
I think St.

26:19.671 --> 26:27.079
Mary's must have been maybe the first or second school outside of Chicago that instituted that kind of program.

26:27.539 --> 26:40.071
So through the great philosophers, poets and writers and so forth over a course of four years,

26:41.182 --> 26:56.116
By virtue of that, I got a degree in English, but I took so many other courses which were combined into this program that I had two minors, one in philosophy and one in psychology.

26:58.482 --> 26:59.865
It doesn't mean I have to go, you know, like,

27:01.634 --> 27:10.674
But the program didn't really have a, what do you call it, a degree status, let's put it that way.

27:11.856 --> 27:20.014
So it was a combination of different courses in the different parts of the school, plus the one that's sort of the core.

27:20.905 --> 27:34.204
that were used, that really focused on what you would call the great books, starting with Homer and then all the way up, Aristotle, Socrates, or Plato, and so forth.

27:35.386 --> 27:42.396
So that really was very formative as well in terms of how I looked in the world.

27:43.237 --> 27:47.503
And Vatican II came along and I was involved with...

27:48.125 --> 28:00.970
not so much covering it, but certainly writing synopses of whatever, just doing whatever I was asked to do.

28:03.262 --> 28:15.319
So when I met Cesar again, I already had that inclination.

28:15.339 --> 28:19.965
I mean, I was already devoted or dedicated to social justice issues.

28:20.065 --> 28:29.218
And my wife and I had both been doing different activities, actions, really.

28:30.076 --> 28:34.086
to promote social justice, certainly in Sacramento County.

28:35.610 --> 28:45.975
But with this, I think it gave me more of a broader perspective, you know, on what needed to

28:47.660 --> 28:52.507
there that only me canos could deal with.

28:54.650 --> 29:04.825
When you say that Cesaro kind of recruited you, does that mean that you became like some kind of official?

29:05.902 --> 29:14.511
I don't want to say biographer, but somebody who followed the UFW strikes or different things like that.

29:14.531 --> 29:16.773
No, I wouldn't call myself that at all.

29:17.374 --> 29:20.277
I was too far away from day-to-day stuff.

29:20.898 --> 29:23.200
I became a friend of his over the years.

29:25.342 --> 29:28.025
I didn't see him every now and then.

29:28.045 --> 29:30.608
In fact, I probably saw him more in Washington, D.C.

29:30.628 --> 29:31.048
than I did.

29:32.581 --> 29:35.187
Because he came out there, you know, pretty often.

29:35.828 --> 29:37.572
And then I would visit out here and such.

29:37.592 --> 29:43.184
But yeah, he was always a great influence.

29:43.385 --> 29:45.409
You know, I consider him a friend.

29:46.317 --> 29:47.779
And a mentor.

29:48.860 --> 29:59.134
Not so much me talking to him, but following him and really devoting myself to the kind of issues that he had.

29:59.434 --> 30:07.064
So he came out looking for people to help him, and I happened to be part of the catch.

30:07.765 --> 30:10.508
He threw out the net.

30:10.969 --> 30:15.615
So that's...

30:16.152 --> 30:23.101
a brown like 1964, 1965 and that kind of area, mid sixties.

30:23.682 --> 30:34.356
So what, um, what then, or how do you see that being connected to what eventually becomes kind of like the full blown Chicano movement?

30:34.376 --> 30:35.237
Right.

30:35.257 --> 30:35.397
Yeah.

30:35.417 --> 30:37.480
Well, it wasn't, there wasn't a Chicano movement.

30:38.081 --> 30:43.628
They didn't really get out there until about late, actually late sixties with the, um,

30:47.523 --> 30:51.950
When it became, you know, Chicano became a thing.

30:54.453 --> 30:56.156
But there were a lot of people ready for it.

30:56.556 --> 30:59.380
I mean, just thank you for something to grab onto.

31:02.285 --> 31:09.996
I had, by that time, in 67, I was recruited by the U.S.

31:10.036 --> 31:16.686
Commission on Civil Rights for a job in their public affairs press office.

31:17.257 --> 31:18.238
in Washington, D.C.

31:19.881 --> 31:27.672
And strangely enough, the reason that I was at this particular convention, it was, I think it was MAPA.

31:29.394 --> 31:29.895
New MAPA?

31:30.656 --> 31:32.198
American Political Association?

31:33.600 --> 31:34.702
Okay.

31:36.845 --> 31:39.889
I can't remember exactly where the heck it was, but it was...

31:41.236 --> 31:46.023
Is that an offshoot of, like, Luzak, the mop-up stuff?

31:46.043 --> 32:02.225
No, it's a political... I can't think of all the people that were involved with it, of course, but there was a conference, and I went to attend it, again, looking for a story.

32:02.365 --> 32:09.775
Plus, I was interested, you know, Chicano, or at least I was a Mexican-American, an activist, I said.

32:10.784 --> 32:14.905
And apparently there was somebody...

32:15.560 --> 32:42.494
I know who it was, but this fellow was recruiting for the commission, and he was asking around for somebody or people with different kind of skills, and I guess he asked the right person if he or they knew somebody that was a reporter or had that kind of background, and they told him, well, check Rondon, you know.

32:44.156 --> 32:45.398
So he handed me down, and

32:45.715 --> 32:46.997
We started chatting.

32:49.039 --> 32:51.823
I said, yeah, I'm interested, you know.

32:51.843 --> 32:53.165
Tell me more about it and so forth.

32:53.185 --> 33:06.763
So we did a phone interview, and they sent me a letter asking me if I would join the commission.

33:06.783 --> 33:10.508
Because I told Helen about this, my wife.

33:11.315 --> 33:19.148
and we didn't know what would happen if some guy just came and talked to me

33:20.292 --> 33:31.243
But sure enough, they offered me a job, which at that time, it was a pretty great salary, you know, even though it was like, I wouldn't say how much it was.

33:32.484 --> 33:40.632
But nowadays, it'd have to be a sizable amount of money to drag me from here to go to Washington, D.C.

33:43.015 --> 33:49.101
At that time, it was announced that we said, yeah, well, and she was game, so we, we, we,

33:49.469 --> 33:56.177
I accepted the job and they shipped all our stuff out there, which was, you know, part of the deal.

33:57.538 --> 33:59.040
And so I ended up in Washington, D.C.

33:59.060 --> 33:59.480
in 67.

33:59.600 --> 34:16.219
So a lot of stuff that happened with the farm workers, with some of the other, like, I did go to Denver later on, but I hadn't, I was, like, involved at that time and just, you know, this new job and

34:16.942 --> 34:19.444
learning how to deal with Washington, D.C.

34:20.605 --> 34:23.928
So that was a whole different change, right?

34:24.349 --> 34:27.772
From Sacramento to Washington, D.C.

34:28.332 --> 34:30.054
Sort of a culture climb.

34:30.074 --> 34:31.635
We thought everything was just so fast.

34:32.976 --> 34:33.897
We were so busy.

34:34.037 --> 34:34.678
What's going on?

34:37.520 --> 34:39.342
That was before we had to go out of New York City.

34:40.343 --> 34:41.664
It was something that was like that.

34:43.466 --> 34:44.907
So that was...

34:45.798 --> 34:48.552
a big change for us and I got involved with

34:49.831 --> 34:52.255
Politicos, you know, in D.C.

34:52.655 --> 34:55.720
Ed Roybal, for example, I met him.

34:55.740 --> 34:59.385
He was one of the first congressmen from California.

35:02.390 --> 35:06.095
Gonzalez from San Antonio.

35:07.077 --> 35:14.228
And then I started meeting other people that had also been recruited out of the Southwest.

35:14.248 --> 35:17.813
And see, that's an interesting thing, too, that...

35:18.350 --> 35:47.884
there was some activity with affirmative action right and sort of started with with kennedy but when johnson came in lyndon johnson he was from texas and you know he knew mexicanos mexican americans uh and so he was more i think more open to uh to the idea of yeah you know getting more mexican americans into into government because at that time it was probably a hard

35:51.003 --> 36:01.453
I can't remember his first name, but it'll probably come to me after we finish.

36:03.175 --> 36:06.078
So there was only one from Congress and then Ed Roybal.

36:07.059 --> 36:09.882
So there were just a handful of Mexicanos there.

36:11.403 --> 36:20.993
But then when Johnson came in, he was pressed by Mexicanos more and more to hire more Raza.

36:22.441 --> 36:47.335
and he you know he put out an order to the agencies on an executive order i guess you'd call it um saying that they had to go out and recruit mixed americas in the southwest to be part of the commission no no to be part of the federal government oh i see in other words he had all the agencies right on the orders to just start doing that that's why this fellow uh the name of sam simmons

36:48.091 --> 36:53.416
came out here to these conventions and so forth to look for people like myself.

36:53.857 --> 37:04.367
So you're saying he was doing kind of an affirmative action, trying to fill different positions in different departments.

37:05.128 --> 37:13.457
I think Kennedy might have done a little bit, because he had the Viva Kennedy drives and all this during his campaign.

37:13.477 --> 37:16.900
But I don't believe he had, maybe he didn't have a chance either.

37:18.584 --> 37:23.711
And just to clarify, you said that that was the U.S.

37:23.791 --> 37:25.172
Commission on Civil Rights?

37:25.232 --> 37:25.513
Yes.

37:25.533 --> 37:26.134
Is that right?

37:26.154 --> 37:28.036
Okay.

37:29.678 --> 37:40.592
I started meeting Mexican-Americans from throughout the Southwest, Midwest, and lifelong friends.

37:41.517 --> 37:50.414
A lot of them have passed away now, but yeah, so I started to get an idea of what was going on around the country.

37:51.837 --> 37:58.570
Because of my job at the commission, I got a chance to travel to different places, like my hometown.

37:58.590 --> 38:01.416
I really hadn't been able to travel that much to San Antonio.

38:02.476 --> 38:10.826
uh, San Antonio, uh, South, South Texas, California, uh, even into, uh, Midwest.

38:10.846 --> 38:25.763
I went to Chicago, to, um, Michigan, uh, to Washington, Washington state, uh, Oregon, uh, of course, California, uh, New Mexico, Denver.

38:25.783 --> 38:31.369
So I started to like, um, make these, these trips, which are often or, uh,

38:32.142 --> 38:34.044
you know, related to commission work.

38:34.064 --> 38:48.943
I mean, I was doing some kind of research because one of the things that I was asked to do with a fellow who was hired about the same time I was, was to start a magazine, right?

38:48.963 --> 38:51.406
And this was called the Civil Rights Digest.

38:53.028 --> 38:56.732
And it consisted of stories

38:58.147 --> 39:06.101
something not as formal as the research and findings that they would publish, you know, from their hearings and so forth.

39:06.121 --> 39:14.876
These were more like anecdotal or, you know, on-the-scene types of reporting of some activity going on that had to do with civil rights.

39:16.458 --> 39:17.340
So I got to do that.

39:17.360 --> 39:22.028
And by the way, you know, I started meeting people like Riestegeri,

39:23.088 --> 39:30.415
José González, José Ángel Gutiérrez who was one of the key guys

39:34.242 --> 39:35.624
So I started meeting all these people.

39:35.664 --> 39:37.786
I met Dolores Huerta, of course, here.

39:41.151 --> 39:47.599
Just a whole range of people that were very active in the movement.

39:47.619 --> 39:50.602
By this time it was a movement, by the 67 and 69.

39:52.324 --> 39:58.512
And I think most people don't realize that it didn't really hit

39:59.555 --> 40:07.122
They kind of started at 65 because there was some protests going on and this and that.

40:07.142 --> 40:12.767
But it didn't really start to gel as a movement until the late 60s.

40:13.928 --> 40:15.069
And then it really got going.

40:19.433 --> 40:24.077
So yeah, if it hadn't been for this fellow Sam Simmons, Lyndon Johnson sending Sam out.

40:25.078 --> 40:27.520
I think he told Sam, you go out and get Rendon.

40:31.499 --> 40:38.668
So we moved out there and I started getting all these contacts.

40:38.888 --> 40:52.224
And as I was going along, I was keeping notes and whatnot and picking up articles and newspapers that were being published at the time, all that kind of thing.

40:53.806 --> 40:58.992
And by 1969,

41:00.777 --> 41:05.202
I had gotten the idea that somebody should be writing this down, you know.

41:06.644 --> 41:11.289
And so I said, well, why don't you do it to myself?

41:13.672 --> 41:19.138
So you kind of took on the mantle of like an archivist, right?

41:19.738 --> 41:21.801
Or like a current.

41:21.821 --> 41:28.508
Like, yeah, I was often on the scene of events that were key to the movement, you know.

41:28.889 --> 41:29.029
Uh-huh.

41:29.380 --> 41:36.229
I was down in South Texas when Mayo was organizing.

41:37.330 --> 41:41.595
And that morphed into the La Raza Unida.

41:44.138 --> 41:45.340
And of course with the boycott.

41:47.383 --> 41:50.226
I went to one of the Christopher Justice meetings in Denver.

41:52.209 --> 41:53.550
Just things like that were going.

41:53.570 --> 41:55.793
And Reyes Tijerina, I met him.

41:56.819 --> 42:00.083
kind of in the midst of all that was going on with the Glangrad movement, you know?

42:00.463 --> 42:09.132
But before they attacked that prison in Pera Maria, things like that.

42:10.454 --> 42:25.510
So in a way, I was observing and recording, but I was also realized, like I said, by the late 1969

42:26.384 --> 42:52.324
maybe it was earlier than that because let's see what came out in 71 I guess it was early 69 that I got the idea of writing a book about it which would become Chicano Manifesto yeah so it kind of sounds like

42:52.777 --> 43:13.333
what happened or what the story you were telling about the cursillos right that you went to go do a story on this and then kind of found yourself immersed in it as well right or eventually immersed in it would you say that kind of occurred with the chicano movement stuff and you're

43:14.242 --> 43:17.388
kind of the activism within it or your, you know?

43:17.408 --> 43:36.165
Well, yeah, I think it was a process that I was involved with and I had a good sense to kind of keep observing and not become totally involved in it because, you know, you can get involved in something to understand that you lose sight of

43:38.474 --> 43:50.192
So I was, so I've never committed to one aspect of the movement or the other, because it was, you know, the kind of movement was a number of moving parts.

43:50.573 --> 43:50.713
Right.

43:50.733 --> 43:55.500
It wasn't just, you know, one solid mass of people on one thing.

43:57.063 --> 43:57.203
Mm-hmm.

43:57.263 --> 43:59.166
It was more of, I'm going to talk about these things.

44:02.673 --> 44:04.155
I've been reading through it.

44:04.175 --> 44:06.737
Yeah, but it was, uh, now do you have the latest edition?

44:08.319 --> 44:09.821
Uh, I have... 96 edition?

44:11.022 --> 44:12.203
I have this edition.

44:12.223 --> 44:14.105
Yeah, that's the latest one.

44:14.125 --> 44:14.245
Okay.

44:14.266 --> 44:21.073
I might have to reprint it for, uh, it came out in 71, so two more years, it'll be 50 years that it came out.

44:21.093 --> 44:22.034
Yeah.

44:22.154 --> 44:25.317
Yeah, you're going to have to do a 50th anniversary.

44:25.357 --> 44:26.198
Right, right.

44:26.218 --> 44:30.423
I don't want to hear more about the 50th anniversary.

44:30.443 --> 44:30.503
Um,

44:32.002 --> 44:35.988
Because, you know, I'm really focused on getting people to think about the next 50 years.

44:36.008 --> 44:36.969
Right, right.

44:37.871 --> 44:43.760
Well, you could include your blueprint in the 50th anniversary.

44:44.921 --> 44:45.242
I will.

44:45.683 --> 44:47.165
What was I going to say?

44:47.185 --> 44:48.627
Well, you were talking about how...

44:48.961 --> 45:06.733
It made me also think about how it was a process where I was sort of assimilating stuff, absorbing ideas, and they all kind of came together when I got the idea for the book.

45:08.182 --> 45:14.569
And again, it was just, I don't know, just luck or just being at the right place at the right time.

45:14.589 --> 45:23.258
But I think there was some interest in some of the major publishing companies to do a Chicano book, right?

45:24.219 --> 45:26.081
And a lot of them did a Chicano book.

45:26.702 --> 45:28.223
That was it.

45:28.624 --> 45:32.087
But I approached Macmillan among probably a couple others maybe.

45:33.589 --> 45:35.691
And they expressed interest right away.

45:37.122 --> 45:42.831
Got me in touch with one of the editors who was excellent.

45:42.851 --> 45:45.395
He directed me along the path.

45:48.440 --> 45:55.010
He went out to work somewhere else and then I got another editor, but it all worked out really well.

45:56.252 --> 46:00.398
But they gave me an advance, which I had to pay off.

46:01.640 --> 46:04.024
That's what advance means.

46:04.561 --> 46:05.442
It wasn't free money.

46:06.183 --> 46:09.466
But so I, you know, I sold enough books.

46:09.526 --> 46:11.689
I paid back the advance.

46:11.789 --> 46:20.098
And over the years, you know, it keeps, you know, every month I get a little check here and there.

46:20.118 --> 46:26.345
But if I had written it in order to make money, I'd have been a poor man.

46:29.148 --> 46:29.988
But it's still out there.

46:30.008 --> 46:31.310
And I'm happy about that.

46:31.790 --> 46:32.351
Yeah.

46:32.812 --> 46:34.213
So there's a lot of stuff that, you know,

46:35.054 --> 46:58.041
you're bringing it out here which is uh it's interesting to me yeah and i think it's gonna be well i mean part of like the reason why i'm doing this oral history is not just for my own project but also because you know like my parents were involved in the chicano movement too and i just don't hear or see a lot of

46:58.662 --> 47:07.871
new work that's recording a lot of different perspectives on it and from the people who were there, right?

47:07.891 --> 47:21.624
Like there's a lot of, there's a lot of books about it, but it's, you know, from these very, um, you know, how the historians, they call it like this great man type of approach to history.

47:21.744 --> 47:22.104
Right.

47:22.204 --> 47:25.227
So you only look at Cesar Chavez, you only look at

47:25.662 --> 47:43.351
Corky Gonzalez, but you're not talking to the people, you know, the nameless, the nameless people who, I mean, not that you're particularly nameless, but, you know, people who were not those central figures, right?

47:44.212 --> 47:52.125
And so I wanted to kind of record that and, you know, be able to collect those memories from people

47:52.713 --> 48:12.662
who were there and well I before we maybe move on to the next big question I do want to kind of chat with you a little bit about the Chicano Manifesto and like what do you see as

48:13.317 --> 48:18.165
Was it for you a project of just documenting?

48:18.305 --> 48:28.221
Was it a project of, you know, here's what the central themes of the Chicano movement were about?

48:28.822 --> 48:32.147
Here's what their philosophy was?

48:32.588 --> 48:34.932
You want me to stop?

48:34.992 --> 48:35.853
Yeah.

48:35.873 --> 48:36.214
Sure.

48:37.857 --> 48:40.641
Yeah, so I was just...

48:40.891 --> 49:09.463
asking you about the chicano manifesto and what you envisioned its purpose to be was it like more descriptive like here's here's what's going on in the chicano movement here's all the different elements or was it was your intention to make it kind of prescriptive like here's what chicanismo is about and you know what i mean well it's uh

49:09.899 --> 49:10.820
Or maybe it's both.

49:11.400 --> 49:13.402
I think it's both and maybe more.

49:14.523 --> 49:26.094
I think it's a synthesizing of all that together into what I think is what a lot of people have.

49:26.114 --> 49:36.244
I think that the manifesto is a kind of a snapshot of what was going on at the time.

49:37.507 --> 49:41.653
but also kind of an idea of what was going on in my mind.

49:42.334 --> 49:56.474
Like I say, all this formative stuff that had been going on from being in the barrio, San Antonio, and then moving on here, going to St.

49:56.554 --> 49:58.036
Mary's and all that kind of stuff.

49:59.298 --> 50:05.607
When I got the idea for the book, at first, I think at first I did think it was going to be

50:06.278 --> 50:13.285
mostly taking different parts of it, like what's going on in Denver and that idea.

50:16.028 --> 50:28.962
I can't, you're asking me to look back and see at what stage something like that particular book became different than just a history.

50:31.224 --> 50:34.648
Because at some point, I must have

50:35.978 --> 50:54.006
sort of morphed from observer, just an observer, just a chronicler, into someone who actually had an idea about what the movement was about, what Chicanismo was about.

50:55.989 --> 51:04.382
And in your case, you're studying to be a doctor of philosophy, a real philosophy, not just a PhD in the

51:05.223 --> 51:08.666
sort of normative sense, you know, like everybody gets a PhD, it's a doctor.

51:11.428 --> 51:16.333
So more in the sense of what did it mean?

51:18.134 --> 51:21.918
How should people view Chikanismo?

51:23.799 --> 51:33.508
And so everything kind of came together in that sense that I was able to see sort of the whole picture.

51:34.012 --> 51:35.434
from poor boys in Washington, D.C.

51:35.795 --> 51:39.660
This is what's interesting about my going to Washington, D.C.

51:40.201 --> 51:46.571
Remember how I said something about how you can get involved in something to the extent that you don't see what's going on around it, right?

51:46.591 --> 51:47.692
This becomes the focus.

51:47.712 --> 51:48.594
This is your commitment.

51:48.654 --> 51:50.837
Boom, that's it.

51:51.918 --> 51:56.004
And because I went to Washington, D.C., I didn't get into that groove.

51:58.809 --> 52:03.816
So I wasn't committed to the grape work, the grape strike,

52:04.387 --> 52:14.080
I saw them as pieces of a whole.

52:15.702 --> 52:24.353
And you're attributing that to being kind of like removed, like not fully entrenched in those communities, but...

52:24.687 --> 52:35.121
Yeah, people talk about seeing an issue from face-to-face or from 30,000 feet, that sort of thing.

52:35.141 --> 52:40.349
I was able to kind of see what was going on and then put it all together.

52:41.931 --> 52:53.547
And it torn my mind in terms of how I saw not only the Chicano movement as a...

52:53.965 --> 53:08.379
and actively moving forward type of thing, but what it meant to people in terms of mindset, a philosophy, if you will.

53:11.642 --> 53:13.864
Why become a Chicano?

53:16.086 --> 53:21.171
So I think that's why you have one of the chapters toward the end is a really personal,

53:21.742 --> 53:33.740
I call it a personal manifesto, in fact, where I talk about some of these things that were mentioned here, but without getting as much depth, because, you know, if you're talking about a book here, I'm just, I don't know.

53:34.781 --> 53:35.102
Yeah.

53:35.122 --> 53:36.003
Yeah, shining away.

53:36.083 --> 53:45.357
But so all of that, those formative years sort of came together with the manifesto.

53:46.799 --> 53:46.939
Mm-hmm.

53:47.290 --> 53:54.038
And you can kind of see all the circumstances that took place for me to be in Washington, D.C., you know.

53:55.460 --> 53:55.940
Yeah.

53:55.960 --> 53:57.222
Otherwise, I couldn't have written it.

53:57.242 --> 54:11.999
I don't think someone who was in California and had the focus of, you know, just farm workers and all this could have written the book, or nor somebody that was just in New Mexico.

54:12.019 --> 54:15.643
They would have written a book about the Langdon movement, most likely, you know.

54:16.467 --> 54:31.368
Or, I mean, I think about, like, my parents were members of Teatro Campesino during that time period, probably both, like, around 68, 69, 70.

54:34.272 --> 54:42.323
And, like, when my dad talks about it, he talks about, you know, that they did a lot of tours throughout the United States.

54:42.758 --> 54:54.209
And that that was kind of like what you're saying that they got or at least speaking for himself, that he got a glimpse of these different aspects of the Chicano movement.

54:54.310 --> 54:54.630
Right.

54:56.592 --> 55:02.758
But I think that, you know, is my dad going to write a book like Chicano Manifesto?

55:02.798 --> 55:05.381
Probably not, because that's not his.

55:05.601 --> 55:06.382
He's not a writer.

55:06.562 --> 55:07.703
You know, he's an actor.

55:08.172 --> 55:11.736
He's a, well, he calls himself a propagandist.

55:11.756 --> 55:12.657
Oh, yeah.

55:12.857 --> 55:14.438
What's his name?

55:14.799 --> 55:16.220
My dad, Felix Alvarez.

55:16.480 --> 55:17.361
Felix Alvarez.

55:18.202 --> 55:24.769
Yeah, so I think it's just like a different kind of medium, right?

55:24.789 --> 55:25.790
Yeah.

55:26.350 --> 55:36.981
I think that's the point I was thinking about, too, is that someone who's an actor, who sees the world from a different perspective than most people,

55:37.568 --> 55:45.476
would be able to recognize that this is something different and see that it has different moving parts.

55:46.718 --> 55:51.903
And it all becomes part of the teatro.

55:52.664 --> 56:01.193
They would have scenes that would relate to what's going on in New Mexico, maybe you're in Texas or what have you, because they would have become, they absorb that.

56:01.753 --> 56:05.517
And Luis Valdez, he's a master of that.

56:06.442 --> 56:10.066
it comes out in what they do, right?

56:10.747 --> 56:13.850
So what I do is write.

56:14.691 --> 56:17.414
So I had that opportunity to put it all together.

56:18.615 --> 56:30.829
That's why I say I'm not like saying that I'm the only person, I'm just so unique that I would only do it, but the background that I had brought me to that point.

56:31.028 --> 56:32.690
where I had that perspective, you know.

56:32.990 --> 56:33.110
Right.

56:33.390 --> 56:44.881
And I, today, if I hadn't, you know, told myself or, you know, said to myself something like, well, somebody should write this book.

56:45.081 --> 56:47.203
And I answer myself, why don't you write it?

56:47.784 --> 56:49.566
You know, do something about it.

56:50.587 --> 56:53.189
It would never have been written.

56:53.209 --> 56:55.131
You know, if I said, I don't think I can do it.

56:55.191 --> 56:57.373
It's got the kids, you know, I had,

56:57.758 --> 57:04.168
By that time, I had probably at least three and a half kids, I think.

57:04.188 --> 57:05.309
The fourth one was on his way.

57:05.830 --> 57:08.755
He was born in March 1970.

57:08.815 --> 57:13.462
So I was working on the book at that time.

57:14.203 --> 57:17.087
Yeah, I might have just had all kinds of excuses.

57:18.590 --> 57:18.690
Yeah.

57:18.710 --> 57:25.039
I don't know if I would even remember that now, and I would regret it, you know?

57:25.060 --> 57:26.061
But...

57:27.037 --> 57:30.921
Well, anyway, I did.

57:32.262 --> 57:37.547
So let me think if there's anything else I wanted to ask about that.

57:37.727 --> 57:38.428
I don't think so.

57:38.588 --> 57:41.611
It'll probably come up in the next question.

57:42.251 --> 57:55.744
But perhaps before we move on to that second question, is there anything else you want to maybe add about your participation in the Chicano movement?

57:56.737 --> 58:02.525
Well, only to say that I never participated as such.

58:02.725 --> 58:22.812
I'm not in the sense like probably the only place where I had a real involvement was when we were in California with, you know, the farm worker movement and the grape boycott and where, you know, we would pack the kids up and go to a,

58:23.399 --> 58:25.524
the Lucky's in Sacramento.

58:25.544 --> 58:37.611
And we have a picture of two of the first two kids in a cart, you know, a grocery cart, Lucky's grocery cart, you know, walking around.

58:42.367 --> 58:47.999
pretty bold, using our own cards to wheel our kids around.

58:50.244 --> 59:01.928
So I wasn't a participant in the Langrand movement or in the Corpus Christi or Corgi Gonzalez.

59:02.633 --> 59:06.700
It wasn't like being aloof, but I was in Washington, D.C.

59:09.104 --> 59:26.295
The only possible part of the movement that has really not been, and I did very little on it in the book, was the activism among federal workers, people that went to work in Washington, D.C.

59:26.596 --> 59:39.271
and made a big difference in how laws were structured and how policies were implemented, like in bilingual education programs, housing programs.

59:40.673 --> 59:50.085
A lot of stuff went on at that level that I don't think has ever really been properly addressed.

59:50.525 --> 59:52.047
And you would include that?

59:52.347 --> 59:55.031
within the Chicano movement?

59:55.051 --> 59:55.231
Oh, yeah.

59:55.251 --> 59:56.273
Absolutely.

59:56.293 --> 59:56.994
Absolutely.

59:57.194 --> 01:00:03.963
I spent a little bit on it because one of the, it was called the Huarache Walkout.

01:00:03.983 --> 01:00:05.145
And I think, what was it?

01:00:05.165 --> 01:00:11.694
I think it took place in New Mexico around 1969 or so.

01:00:11.734 --> 01:00:21.628
And that's where there was a bunch of federal employees brought together or something to discuss whatever.

01:00:23.110 --> 01:00:43.920
They basically walked out because the whole program was directed at boosting the administration and so forth and not really addressing issues that were vital to the Americans.

01:00:44.491 --> 01:00:50.337
I mentioned that in the Manifesto, but yeah, I think that was a very important one.

01:00:51.538 --> 01:00:53.560
Again, Lyndon Johnson had a lot to do with it.

01:00:54.201 --> 01:01:03.090
I don't know if he actually realized what he was doing, but he was certainly instrumental.

01:01:05.072 --> 01:01:11.359
And so after, or maybe in the process of writing Chicano Manifesto, that's when you kind of

01:01:11.947 --> 01:01:14.451
You took on that identity as a Chicano?

01:01:15.894 --> 01:01:17.537
No, I accepted that.

01:01:17.577 --> 01:01:18.719
Beforehand.

01:01:18.819 --> 01:01:31.441
Oh, yeah, like the late 60s, when it became more prominent, especially after the crucifixist meetings where it started to become current.

01:01:31.502 --> 01:01:36.891
Nobody was a Chicano until about then, late 60s, right?

01:01:37.478 --> 01:01:39.081
Yeah.

01:01:39.562 --> 01:01:39.902
All right.

01:01:40.063 --> 01:01:48.518
So let me go ahead and kind of pivot to my next question, which is a lot more related to my dissertation project.

01:01:49.339 --> 01:01:58.556
And that deals with the concept of mestizaje, which you're familiar with mestizaje?

01:01:58.756 --> 01:01:59.537
Of course.

01:01:59.557 --> 01:01:59.678
Okay.

01:01:59.698 --> 01:01:59.858
Okay.

01:02:00.260 --> 01:02:25.120
So, part of what I'm trying to understand or uncover in these interviews is where people who are coming of age or who are, you know, young adults during this time period, where they...

01:02:25.741 --> 01:02:34.333
It's one of these kind of principles that comes out and becomes popularized, especially in the U.S., right?

01:02:34.354 --> 01:02:37.478
During and after the Chicano movement.

01:02:37.678 --> 01:02:50.517
And so I'm curious to find out whether there was any effect between people's involvement with the Chicano movement and their understanding of mestizaje or

01:02:50.952 --> 01:02:54.617
You know, what is your understanding of that concept?

01:02:54.657 --> 01:02:56.360
Where do you think it came from?

01:02:58.323 --> 01:03:00.105
Did you identify with it?

01:03:00.386 --> 01:03:01.607
Those types of questions.

01:03:02.228 --> 01:03:10.901
Well, first of all, just not so much to correct you, but to put a different spin on what you just said about before and after the Chicana movement.

01:03:12.003 --> 01:03:14.987
I don't think the Chicana movement is an after.

01:03:15.027 --> 01:03:16.369
There's an after to it.

01:03:16.389 --> 01:03:17.390
It's a continuation.

01:03:18.372 --> 01:03:18.512
Mm-hmm.

01:03:20.686 --> 01:03:36.107
not, you know, there's some people that are still protesting in the Chicano power and all this, but it's a continuum and it's evolving pretty much all the time.

01:03:39.772 --> 01:03:43.116
So having said that, I think what

01:03:44.986 --> 01:03:56.864
one of the elements that makes it still alive is Mestizaje, the sense of indigeneity, I'll put it that way too, okay?

01:03:57.746 --> 01:04:09.504
As the dominant basis on which we identify as Mexican Americans, or we Mexican Americans identify as a people, let me put it that way.

01:04:11.967 --> 01:04:13.069
Because...

01:04:15.209 --> 01:04:29.337
When I wrote Chicano Manifesto, there's several places where I talk about a need for us to align ourselves with Indian tribes.

01:04:31.220 --> 01:04:33.184
And I don't think I quite...

01:04:33.603 --> 01:04:39.590
put it out there that we were another tribe.

01:04:41.432 --> 01:04:45.977
I had to read the whole thing over again to see if I specifically said it like that.

01:04:46.017 --> 01:04:52.565
I kind of looked through it every now and then to see if there's any nuance of that sort.

01:04:55.268 --> 01:04:58.311
But I think I was mostly thinking of

01:04:59.185 --> 01:05:07.054
Mexican-Americans as, well, Mexican-Americans, you know, just a mixture of Indian and Spanish, right?

01:05:08.315 --> 01:05:20.789
And I think most Mexican-Americans, the people who became Chicanos, pretty much had the same sort of lack of vision at the time.

01:05:22.691 --> 01:05:23.652
Lack of vision?

01:05:23.912 --> 01:05:25.834
Yeah, in terms of

01:05:26.557 --> 01:05:32.062
what it really meant to be Mexican-American.

01:05:34.904 --> 01:05:49.237
In the sense that we talked about being indigenous, but we didn't really accept what that really meant.

01:05:49.777 --> 01:05:55.602
We didn't necessarily understand what we were saying, because we hadn't really thought it out.

01:05:56.273 --> 01:06:13.136
And, you know, had we had more of that kind of discussion, what it means in terms of how we should think, how we should form our thoughts and our actions with that concept in mind.

01:06:13.917 --> 01:06:23.209
And I think right now where many of us are, and this is part of the blueprint, is our need to

01:06:24.353 --> 01:06:27.978
really discovered what that indigeneity means.

01:06:29.260 --> 01:06:36.890
And my way of thinking is that it has become the dominant element of our being.

01:06:41.436 --> 01:06:43.218
Because that's how we're going to survive.

01:06:43.899 --> 01:06:45.822
That's a whole different discussion.

01:06:51.229 --> 01:06:53.652
I became aware of it

01:06:55.353 --> 01:07:14.336
more so in the mid-'80s about my indigenous indigeneity, let's put it there, Mesisaje, because I became involved, actually working with Indian tribes at a different level, different basis.

01:07:15.618 --> 01:07:24.769
But in the late 60s, I think the whole idea of Mesisaje, of our being...

01:07:25.897 --> 01:07:39.335
you know, Browns, part of the Browns nation and all that, really evolved out of Lorista, the poet, okay, and what he brought out in the Crusade for Justice.

01:07:39.356 --> 01:07:43.822
I think it was the first meeting was in 68 or something.

01:07:44.382 --> 01:07:46.606
The Plan Espiritual.

01:07:46.626 --> 01:07:48.047
Yeah, that was like 68, I think.

01:07:49.469 --> 01:07:50.331
Or rather, sometime.

01:07:51.552 --> 01:07:52.073
And...

01:07:53.099 --> 01:08:02.191
So that gave a lot of the philosophical ideological groundwork, framework for the Chicano movement.

01:08:05.315 --> 01:08:09.581
But again, we didn't like sit down and really talk about it.

01:08:09.601 --> 01:08:10.322
What does it mean?

01:08:10.382 --> 01:08:21.317
What does it mean in terms of how we relate to all this colonial stuff that's now in colonialism that we now realize

01:08:21.972 --> 01:08:34.587
still undergird so much of the oppression and the discrimination and racism that Mexican Americans still have to deal with day to day.

01:08:36.690 --> 01:08:40.935
Just have to look at the headlines, as they say, what's going on on the border.

01:08:42.317 --> 01:08:46.782
Now, I hear

01:08:47.538 --> 01:08:52.446
the reports that most of the people infected along the border are from Central America.

01:08:55.711 --> 01:09:01.280
Which is not to say that it doesn't really include us, because it does.

01:09:02.402 --> 01:09:10.195
As far as this administration, perhaps others, we're brown and that's down.

01:09:10.916 --> 01:09:12.178
So it doesn't matter who

01:09:12.648 --> 01:09:13.911
where they come from.

01:09:14.292 --> 01:09:24.717
They're brown people and they're part of all these migrants that are here and shouldn't belong here.

01:09:26.063 --> 01:09:40.783
So I think that was the origin of what I would call the philosophical base where Chicanismo is still to be, I think, really addressed.

01:09:40.803 --> 01:09:50.596
Possibly more of the people that are in the SMAP are addressing it and looking at it in terms of what it means down the road.

01:09:50.736 --> 01:09:54.341
I still have not heard.

01:09:54.361 --> 01:09:55.783
You're the first person from SMAP

01:09:56.573 --> 01:10:03.904
that has really gotten back to me and said, you know, like they're interested in the whole question of estisaje, you know?

01:10:07.269 --> 01:10:18.987
And I've run across a few things on academia.edu, you know, which relate to it.

01:10:20.452 --> 01:10:43.526
I really think that a group like SMAP, other scholars, historians, so forth, anthropologists really have to look at this, our indigeneity, and examine it, evolve it, and put it in... Is that me or you?

01:10:43.546 --> 01:10:45.148
I think that's you.

01:10:45.168 --> 01:10:45.649
Oh, that's it.

01:10:52.447 --> 01:10:54.891
This is from San Antonio.

01:10:55.772 --> 01:11:09.374
Okay, yeah, so we were just talking about, you were talking about Mesisahe and, you know, this kind of reshifting of focus to the indigeneity aspect of it, right?

01:11:09.895 --> 01:11:14.522
And that actually raises a question for me because

01:11:15.194 --> 01:11:24.327
when you, it sounds like when you are thinking about the concept of mestizaje, you're focusing more on the indigenous part of it.

01:11:25.328 --> 01:11:26.690
Would that be accurate?

01:11:26.710 --> 01:11:27.912
Absolutely, absolutely.

01:11:27.992 --> 01:11:41.792
I think, well, the future of our existence here in the Americas is, I think, based on our

01:11:41.890 --> 01:11:43.452
I guess focusing is a good word.

01:11:43.612 --> 01:11:51.503
It's like giving a balance, I would think, more with respect to our indigenous origins.

01:11:52.344 --> 01:12:02.638
Because up until now, by and large, the Hispanic side has been dominant.

01:12:02.658 --> 01:12:03.459
This is cool.

01:12:03.499 --> 01:12:07.484
We have a Spanish language and we have customs.

01:12:07.504 --> 01:12:10.328
We have a certain religiosity from it.

01:12:11.219 --> 01:12:28.708
But I think we have to kind of like look at the indigeneity and see how that not only should have more attention, but in terms of our future, that that's where it's at.

01:12:29.810 --> 01:12:35.539
And not in somehow being more

01:12:37.747 --> 01:12:41.831
It's not possible unless we start to talk with a lisp.

01:12:43.592 --> 01:12:45.614
We're not going to do that.

01:12:46.815 --> 01:12:53.081
Or maybe lose sight of who we are from that standpoint.

01:12:53.101 --> 01:12:56.844
Because that's what makes us Mexican-Americans.

01:12:56.864 --> 01:13:00.367
A Chicano is basically a Mexican-American.

01:13:03.910 --> 01:13:06.032
But as I said in the Chicano Manifesto,

01:13:06.991 --> 01:13:12.520
We are Indians with Spanish surnames, okay?

01:13:15.525 --> 01:13:26.383
Because if it had, you know, outside of the whole process that took place in terms of the Spanishization, is that right?

01:13:37.197 --> 01:13:48.393
that one part of it, the Hispanicity, has been dominant.

01:13:48.413 --> 01:14:06.478
And for no other reason than that at one point there was a concerted effort to erase our connection with our indigenous origins, you know, both in terms of languages, which

01:14:07.370 --> 01:14:08.511
has not been successful.

01:14:09.873 --> 01:14:14.437
I don't speak Nahuatl or any other native language, but a lot of people do.

01:14:15.478 --> 01:14:22.505
And I think even more and more Mexicanos and Mexicans are speaking it, studying it, what have you.

01:14:23.486 --> 01:14:28.011
So it could become another language that we speak, that our children could speak.

01:14:29.813 --> 01:14:34.137
And certainly to be able to relate and communicate

01:14:40.107 --> 01:14:49.737
I forget the numbers, but there's a million or two people at least that speak Nahuatl.

01:14:50.838 --> 01:14:53.921
Plus all the other languages that exist, right?

01:14:53.941 --> 01:15:09.557
So it's, I think it's a time right now for us to begin to look at our indigenous origins and sort of revive them

01:15:10.550 --> 01:15:22.845
not just preserve them, but make them more of a part of our actual existence.

01:15:22.865 --> 01:15:25.789
Now, I'm 80 years old.

01:15:26.730 --> 01:15:27.992
I don't think I'm going to learn Nahuatl.

01:15:28.893 --> 01:15:29.313
I tried.

01:15:29.333 --> 01:15:32.177
I tried on my own and it didn't work out.

01:15:34.159 --> 01:15:39.426
But I do have a greater sense of the fact that I have indigenous

01:15:39.743 --> 01:15:42.086
blood, indigenous origins.

01:15:42.987 --> 01:15:47.433
You look at my, this is my side of the family here.

01:15:48.054 --> 01:15:57.427
They're a mixture.

01:15:58.769 --> 01:16:06.139
My grandmother, you see her here down here, and that's my grandfather, Pomposo.

01:16:06.187 --> 01:16:09.671
The one's right below the lamp?

01:16:10.051 --> 01:16:12.755
Yeah, that's pomposo reina.

01:16:13.315 --> 01:16:21.164
And then my grandmother, she might have had some Spanish blood in her, but I doubt it.

01:16:22.946 --> 01:16:35.080
It's just my father, the guy in the cowboy hand at the end, he probably has more Spanish blood that I kind of, as far as my DNA,

01:16:35.954 --> 01:16:45.624
the test that I took and they got the findings, pretty much split between Spanish and indigenous, really half and half.

01:16:46.404 --> 01:16:57.856
I mean, there's about five or six percent that's a lot of both, you know, things, but some basically, you know, half and half.

01:16:57.876 --> 01:17:05.944
Other people are 30 percent more, 30 percent Indian or 70 percent, you know, Spanish.

01:17:10.666 --> 01:17:25.924
But I didn't need to know that in order to realize that, yeah, I'm Mexican, I'm Indian native, and I also have Spanish origins.

01:17:27.606 --> 01:17:31.611
But I want to learn more about my indigenous background.

01:17:32.191 --> 01:17:37.838
And I want to be able to see

01:17:38.813 --> 01:17:59.693
or at least, how can I put it, try to assure that 50 years from now, we don't look back or there's people looking back at the remnants of the Mexican-American community and then look back and say, damn, what are those people doing in those days?

01:17:59.713 --> 01:18:06.660
They didn't do a damn thing to, you know, to preserve our culture, to pass it on.

01:18:07.366 --> 01:18:11.914
to make it stronger, to make it real.

01:18:12.475 --> 01:18:16.922
And that's just something that we were saying, viva la raza and all that kind of stuff.

01:18:18.805 --> 01:18:21.750
Somos indios and this and that.

01:18:22.031 --> 01:18:28.522
So I don't want that to happen 50 years from now, somehow.

01:18:29.123 --> 01:18:32.749
When you talk about mestizaje,

01:18:33.472 --> 01:18:44.028
Like, here's what I hear you saying is that Mesizaje is the mix of indigenous and Spanish.

01:18:45.850 --> 01:18:57.007
But that we have been too focused on trying to elevate or emphasize or follow that kind of Spanish lineage of it.

01:18:57.027 --> 01:18:59.631
And what we need to be doing is kind of

01:19:00.235 --> 01:19:04.340
going on that other path, like taking kind of that other path.

01:19:04.841 --> 01:19:15.694
So in some ways, like I think about, um, you know, like somebody like Vasconcelos who talks about Mesisa as being this mixture, right.

01:19:16.134 --> 01:19:23.303
Or, or even people earlier than that, like, um, Bolivar who will say, well, we're not Indian and we're not Spanish.

01:19:23.343 --> 01:19:25.406
We're something different or something new.

01:19:26.267 --> 01:19:26.407
Right.

01:19:26.427 --> 01:19:26.547
Right.

01:19:26.830 --> 01:19:33.279
And Vasconcelos has kind of like a similar type of angle on it, right?

01:19:33.379 --> 01:19:35.802
That it is this third kind of thing.

01:19:36.383 --> 01:19:41.710
But it sounds like that's not necessarily what you're describing or how you understand it.

01:19:42.751 --> 01:19:46.576
That it is, it's almost like a fork in the road.

01:19:47.057 --> 01:19:49.681
We've been on this fork for a while.

01:19:50.922 --> 01:19:54.026
And now it's time to maybe cross over and be on this fork.

01:19:54.106 --> 01:19:54.948
Is that correct?

01:19:55.088 --> 01:19:55.268
Okay.

01:19:55.670 --> 01:19:56.931
Here's what I believe.

01:19:57.592 --> 01:20:04.660
And I have some evidence for it, a little bit of evidence for it.

01:20:04.680 --> 01:20:08.365
Certainly in my own case, how I feel about my mestizaje.

01:20:09.887 --> 01:20:15.213
And that is that I, like I can't be more Hispanic.

01:20:16.735 --> 01:20:17.195
Pardon the word.

01:20:17.355 --> 01:20:20.078
At least I'm using it as an adjective.

01:20:21.440 --> 01:20:24.023
I can't be more Hispanic than I already am.

01:20:24.475 --> 01:20:26.538
I don't necessarily want to, you know.

01:20:27.419 --> 01:20:38.934
I want to improve my ability to write in Spanish because I'm not very good at writing in Spanish, but I speak it and I understand it and so forth.

01:20:38.954 --> 01:20:45.162
But I would love to be just more fluid and more fluent in Spanish, right, in writing it.

01:20:47.565 --> 01:20:51.630
But that's different from saying that I want to be more of a Hispano.

01:20:52.792 --> 01:21:19.002
What really draws me in terms of whatever years I have going for me and what I see for our community, Mexican-Americans, is that in order to preserve what we have, we have to

01:21:19.741 --> 01:21:22.986
as a people, as being a people, as a nation.

01:21:23.547 --> 01:21:42.575
I use that term in the Chicano Manifesto, and I use it in the blueprint here and there, that the future of this continent, I should say both continents, North and South America, does not lie in more espanidad.

01:21:44.898 --> 01:21:46.120
Because there are

01:21:46.977 --> 01:22:03.177
dozens of hundreds of indigenous tribes, let's put our nation, but people, people is a better word, it's more international value in terms of international law and all that.

01:22:04.338 --> 01:22:11.107
We have all these different peoples who are indigenous in this country and they have survived.

01:22:12.188 --> 01:22:13.049
They are surviving.

01:22:14.371 --> 01:22:14.571
And

01:22:15.057 --> 01:22:25.948
since we've already been Hispanicized, there's this other part of us that needs to be looked at.

01:22:27.930 --> 01:22:39.322
And I think it's what gives us that entree to communicate and align ourselves with other peoples that are indigenous to this country.

01:22:40.783 --> 01:22:44.507
And to a great extent, we are recognized as a tribe.

01:22:45.213 --> 01:22:45.974
American Indians.

01:22:48.697 --> 01:22:50.559
The term that's been used in the U.S.

01:22:51.280 --> 01:22:55.225
Census is Mexican-American Indians.

01:22:58.368 --> 01:23:15.068
In the 2010 census, they found, and I can give you some evidence of this, there's actually a, I might be able to find it if you need it, but there were 175,000 people, that was one of them, who identified ourselves as Mexican-American Indians.

01:23:15.200 --> 01:23:44.380
you put the being of Indian origin and Mexican American ethnicity and that comes out with a Mexican American Indian so they made up this category right let's say they reach people that identify them like this so there's 175,000 of them and as such it is the fifth largest tribe

01:23:45.592 --> 01:23:47.336
among all the tribes in the United States.

01:23:48.138 --> 01:23:55.515
Only I think the Navajo and the Apache and a few others are bigger.

01:23:57.780 --> 01:24:03.533
Only four other tribes, recognized tribes, are bigger than 175,000 people.

01:24:05.302 --> 01:24:08.347
You know, just out of the blue, so to speak.

01:24:08.367 --> 01:24:08.627
Yeah.

01:24:09.349 --> 01:24:28.499
Have you heard of, there's a group, I don't know entirely what their actions have been lately, but the group is called Identify Native 2020, the 2020 census.

01:24:29.000 --> 01:24:29.701
I haven't heard of that.

01:24:29.922 --> 01:24:30.282
You have?

01:24:31.164 --> 01:24:31.444
No, I haven't.

01:24:32.065 --> 01:24:52.564
Yeah, and it's really interesting because a lot of their kind of, well, mostly what they do, I think, is try to get the word out that, A, if you are, if your ancestors are from this side of the world, you're indigenous.

01:24:52.584 --> 01:25:01.532
And the more indigenous people come out and, you know, claim their indigeneity,

01:25:02.204 --> 01:25:09.615
then the more, you know, the invaders will recognize that they're outnumbered here.

01:25:09.835 --> 01:25:11.458
Yeah.

01:25:12.559 --> 01:25:13.621
Follow me on this point.

01:25:13.961 --> 01:25:21.152
I think it is in the manifesto and I've written about it in other instances.

01:25:23.976 --> 01:25:31.367
I even gave a talk in Kuralavaka back in the beginning of August where I talked about the blueprint

01:25:32.478 --> 01:25:44.930
And I pointed out that Mexico should recognize the 40 million Mexicanos that are here.

01:25:48.194 --> 01:26:01.827
Not just in terms of, well, there's a bunch of Mexicans over there, people who see their Mexican origin, but good extent of recognizing this as

01:26:02.650 --> 01:26:12.622
giving us citizenship, citizenship, just by signing a piece of paper, you know?

01:26:12.642 --> 01:26:12.782
Yeah.

01:26:12.802 --> 01:26:29.923
But that's very, very extreme, but sort of recognizing that there are 40 million or so, I suppose that doesn't include the undocumented, but all those many kind of running around this country and

01:26:30.646 --> 01:26:45.324
We have one of the largest gross domestic product, GDP, of I think like 12, only 12 other countries in the world have a higher GDP than we do.

01:26:47.047 --> 01:26:48.729
As a people, as Mexican Americans.

01:26:50.691 --> 01:26:57.700
Which is, I think Mexico is one of the larger than that.

01:26:58.507 --> 01:27:11.239
So economically, let alone in terms of just voting and so forth, we represent a, you know, a big amount of possibilities there, you know?

01:27:11.259 --> 01:27:12.160
Right, right.

01:27:12.180 --> 01:27:17.105
Yeah, and I think that's their kind of point, the identifying Native in 2020.

01:27:17.685 --> 01:27:24.852
Yeah, is to just... But I don't know if that's an ideological concept that they're working on and through or under, but...

01:27:25.321 --> 01:27:49.725
uh more perhaps in terms of programs and money going to uh you know this community or other right um i actually i mean i'm not sure it may have those kinds of consequences as well but i think the main the main kind of role of of that campaign identify native 2020 is

01:27:50.465 --> 01:28:14.937
to simply demonstrate to our own people that hey when we come together we're we're massive right and i think that's that's kind of like the bigger point of not necessarily oh what are we going to get from the government or anything like that or or to even kind of like

01:28:15.811 --> 01:28:43.287
tread on whatever kind of relationships or negotiations are had between you know the quote-unquote recognized tribes within the u.s and the u.s government but i think it's just a demonstration to ourselves and to also everybody else this is a big group you need to contend with it's cool i have to look into that yeah um i don't know if i'm facebook friends with you but um

01:28:43.823 --> 01:28:45.546
I'll send it to you.

01:28:46.347 --> 01:28:47.449
And what is it?

01:28:49.131 --> 01:28:50.934
What is it?

01:28:50.974 --> 01:28:51.876
Recognize your native?

01:28:51.896 --> 01:28:52.457
What is the term?

01:28:52.938 --> 01:28:54.500
Identify native.

01:28:54.600 --> 01:28:55.241
Identify native, okay.

01:28:55.482 --> 01:28:55.922
Yeah.

01:28:56.383 --> 01:29:02.092
You know that in 1979, I was hired by the V.S.

01:29:02.112 --> 01:29:07.040
Census Bureau to go to work on the 1980 census.

01:29:08.182 --> 01:29:10.185
And I was...

01:29:11.735 --> 01:29:21.931
At that time, I was the only one in what they call the Census Promotion Office from 1980 who was Chicano.

01:29:24.495 --> 01:29:34.030
And I was given the task of leading the campaign or starting the campaign or putting together a campaign

01:29:34.617 --> 01:29:37.180
to get Latinos in the U.S.

01:29:37.200 --> 01:29:39.443
to answer the census.

01:29:39.463 --> 01:29:39.923
One guy.

01:29:41.986 --> 01:29:44.449
One guy for all those millions.

01:29:44.469 --> 01:29:44.649
Yeah.

01:29:44.809 --> 01:29:47.452
Fortunately, I mean, they put a lot of money into it.

01:29:47.733 --> 01:29:54.961
I mean, I spent millions of dollars literally coming up with different ideas and programs and stuff.

01:29:55.942 --> 01:29:59.967
But to this day,

01:30:04.705 --> 01:30:14.459
given what it was in 1970 and what happened in 1980, I think we found out there were a lot more Mexicans than we thought, for one thing.

01:30:15.240 --> 01:30:18.925
But yeah, so that was my job.

01:30:19.205 --> 01:30:23.952
And by the way, I was also given the task of reaching out to the native tribes.

01:30:25.114 --> 01:30:29.460
So one guy is supposed to do all this stuff, right?

01:30:29.480 --> 01:30:33.025
I hope they have more for 1990 or 2020.

01:30:33.545 --> 01:30:36.048
2020, yeah.

01:30:36.548 --> 01:30:40.533
So let me go back to the question of mestizaje.

01:30:40.573 --> 01:30:57.392
And so some of the things you mentioned was that you felt like maybe some kind of origin of this concept during the Chicano movement occurred with Alorista.

01:30:57.592 --> 01:30:59.655
And the Plan de Aslan.

01:31:00.837 --> 01:31:07.628
And I'm curious if prior to that, did you have any knowledge of this concept?

01:31:07.648 --> 01:31:12.135
Did you identify as mestizo prior to that?

01:31:13.157 --> 01:31:17.203
I had a sense that I was a mestizo.

01:31:26.178 --> 01:31:35.629
Mexican-American families, and that is where being Indian was looked down upon, as you probably know.

01:31:37.031 --> 01:31:50.187
And there was the same discrimination took place among Mexican families for decades, generations, where you didn't really talk about being Indian.

01:31:50.207 --> 01:31:55.273
Except once in a while, I remember the phrase, se le salio l'Indio.

01:31:55.810 --> 01:31:58.153
you know, which is kind of a put down.

01:31:59.014 --> 01:32:12.272
Somebody got really mad or they did something, you know, shocking or whatever, which is like the Indian came out and he or she did this terrible thing.

01:32:14.695 --> 01:32:20.883
So there's kind of an internal discrimination toward the indigeneity.

01:32:20.903 --> 01:32:23.286
We didn't have all those fancy words for it.

01:32:23.553 --> 01:32:25.717
Yeah.

01:32:25.797 --> 01:32:29.142
So it was kind of a put down in my own family.

01:32:29.162 --> 01:32:35.934
I didn't know who my grandfather, what his origins were until my grandmother died.

01:32:37.116 --> 01:32:40.962
And there was a whole story there, which I won't bore you with.

01:32:40.982 --> 01:32:41.924
It's kind of a funny story.

01:32:41.944 --> 01:32:49.797
But until she died, it was in 1974, I think.

01:32:50.857 --> 01:33:03.089
where I finally found out that he was Kickapoo and that her origins too, you know, because of this thing that had happened some years back.

01:33:03.149 --> 01:33:14.640
She did not want anybody talking about pomposo or indios or anything like that.

01:33:15.361 --> 01:33:16.042
Look at her.

01:33:16.602 --> 01:33:19.345
She looked kind of nice and smiling, but boy, she was tough.

01:33:19.595 --> 01:33:24.803
She raised eight kids by herself, you know, which is part of the story.

01:33:25.084 --> 01:33:37.843
So, you know, out of this background, it was kind of like the door was closed on that.

01:33:37.863 --> 01:33:44.033
And like I say, when she died, I came to the funeral, I had a chance to talk to

01:33:51.185 --> 01:34:02.756
And the whole story started to come out and I realized, geez, it's really true.

01:34:03.717 --> 01:34:04.938
This is what the background is.

01:34:05.539 --> 01:34:09.343
And then I did more research and I know more about those origins and stuff.

01:34:12.566 --> 01:34:16.770
Now, something that's related to this whole discussion is the fact that

01:34:17.712 --> 01:34:28.399
there is a historical and intellectual basis for indigeneity beyond just having family and all this.

01:34:28.740 --> 01:34:31.527
It can become lost in history.

01:34:33.572 --> 01:34:34.354
I would say that

01:34:43.480 --> 01:34:46.624
like in my case and so forth.

01:34:47.145 --> 01:34:55.617
So we have to kind of either find that out or get a sense of what it means to be indigenous.

01:34:56.318 --> 01:35:00.985
If you don't know your tribe, you can't relate to something specifically.

01:35:01.245 --> 01:35:10.939
There's this whole area of discussion and research and analysis and so forth and discussion that needs to take place.

01:35:16.066 --> 01:35:22.455
I think that's where our future lies, getting that kind of understanding.

01:35:25.218 --> 01:35:33.349
So I didn't find out this particular part of my life, my specifics, until the mid-70s.

01:35:34.230 --> 01:35:40.359
And it wasn't until 1985 or so.

01:35:41.500 --> 01:35:45.786
I went back to in 1970...

01:35:47.268 --> 01:35:49.290
was when I started, probably 74.

01:35:51.673 --> 01:35:59.621
I went back to get a degree, an advanced degree, and I chose law.

01:35:59.681 --> 01:36:02.885
So I finally got a law degree in 83.

01:36:02.905 --> 01:36:05.908
It took me like five years.

01:36:07.350 --> 01:36:09.972
I was also working full time at American University.

01:36:10.994 --> 01:36:15.098
I was teaching and then running a program for Latino

01:36:16.158 --> 01:36:17.920
young adults in the Mario.

01:36:20.904 --> 01:36:31.396
But when I decided on law, I've been thinking about getting an advanced degree so I could get more money at American University where I was teaching.

01:36:32.477 --> 01:36:43.971
And nothing really was that interesting, nor was it that inviting in terms of the requirements for a doctorate.

01:36:44.474 --> 01:36:48.619
And law, when I thought about law, I said, yeah, that's what I want to do.

01:36:50.001 --> 01:36:53.686
Because I'd always had an interest in the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo.

01:36:54.967 --> 01:36:56.689
There was some time in the manifesto to it.

01:36:58.111 --> 01:37:05.841
So it took me five years to get to the point where my last year or last semester, I spent

01:37:06.952 --> 01:37:09.715
writing a paper on Chicano, on the treaty.

01:37:10.356 --> 01:37:13.160
It's in the back of this book, and we'll get to it.

01:37:14.261 --> 01:37:27.777
And I was very lucky to get one of the top jurists in the international law who was teaching it at American University at that time, Tom Bergenthal.

01:37:28.939 --> 01:37:32.083
He was my, what do you call it here?

01:37:32.623 --> 01:37:34.005
Sponsor, whatever.

01:37:34.087 --> 01:37:34.848
Like advisor.

01:37:35.049 --> 01:37:36.250
Advisor for it, yeah.

01:37:36.331 --> 01:37:37.512
It was an independent study.

01:37:39.496 --> 01:37:48.990
So I really studied the treaty, and I went all the way back to the Constitution, the U.S.

01:37:49.011 --> 01:37:56.042
Constitution, to look at the law, international law, and its development over that period of time.

01:37:56.062 --> 01:37:59.487
Because I think the Constitution is an international document.

01:38:00.378 --> 01:38:14.135
So as that evolved, I got more and more of a sense that Mexican-Americans are a treaty people.

01:38:16.838 --> 01:38:23.406
As most of the tribes in the United States are based on a treaty.

01:38:23.426 --> 01:38:27.111
So that gives us more of a traditional

01:38:28.373 --> 01:38:36.803
relationship as a people than simply having DNA in us.

01:38:36.964 --> 01:38:49.579
There's a basis in international law, the laws of sovereignty and so forth that connect us and various tribes that recognize that.

01:38:50.300 --> 01:38:55.326
We have a treaty between the US and Mexico that we're the third party.

01:38:55.711 --> 01:39:01.039
In fact, American Indians, other tribes are third parties also.

01:39:03.823 --> 01:39:07.288
Anyway, please try to read through it.

01:39:07.608 --> 01:39:08.590
It's kind of boring.

01:39:08.610 --> 01:39:10.533
I'll get through there.

01:39:11.294 --> 01:39:24.553
Well, that is kind of interesting because it allows for kind of multiple pathways that are not just...

01:39:25.529 --> 01:39:38.864
you know, genetic, you know, oh, our ancestors are from this hemisphere and this land in particular, right?

01:39:39.524 --> 01:39:53.740
But also something that kind of speaks to the way that indigenous sovereignty has been, you know, established in the U.S.

01:39:53.820 --> 01:39:54.861
itself, right?

01:39:55.229 --> 01:39:56.750
So yeah, that's really interesting.

01:39:56.771 --> 01:39:59.113
That's one of the requirements of nationhood.

01:40:00.314 --> 01:40:04.378
That you have some basis for a sovereign status.

01:40:05.559 --> 01:40:05.739
Yeah.

01:40:07.081 --> 01:40:10.564
Now, again, it's one of those things that I've thrown out there, you know.

01:40:10.704 --> 01:40:13.567
No one has really picked up on it yet.

01:40:14.568 --> 01:40:20.494
But it's another area for discussion, for elaboration.

01:40:21.375 --> 01:40:21.895
One of the

01:40:22.162 --> 01:40:26.106
fellows I'm working with on the blueprint, he's very much interested.

01:40:26.126 --> 01:40:29.410
So I hope that he picks up the baton, so to speak.

01:40:29.430 --> 01:40:43.606
Yeah, and I think it's... I think what's interesting about it is that it kind of... It allows for those people who say, you know, we don't need recognition from the United States.

01:40:44.026 --> 01:40:50.233
We don't need European paradigms to tell us we are who we are, right?

01:40:50.753 --> 01:40:52.135
But it also...

01:40:52.351 --> 01:40:59.461
addresses that too and says, hey, look, in your own language, this is what we are, right?

01:40:59.481 --> 01:41:00.903
That's right.

01:41:00.923 --> 01:41:02.025
I try to make the case for it.

01:41:02.065 --> 01:41:03.847
I think it's valid.

01:41:05.229 --> 01:41:07.393
In fact, make it some water.

01:41:07.433 --> 01:41:08.594
Would you like some water?

01:41:09.235 --> 01:41:09.435
Sure.

01:41:10.437 --> 01:41:11.318
We'll take some more.

01:41:13.361 --> 01:41:18.949
Okay, so yeah, we were just talking about the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo and

01:41:19.756 --> 01:41:37.857
what sorts of kind of implications that would have for Mexican-American Chicanos to identify or kind of get closer to... When you talk about mestizaje, in a way, it's a construct.

01:41:38.317 --> 01:41:39.098
It's like races.

01:41:39.839 --> 01:41:49.290
I just saw the other day where somebody mentioned that human beings are like 99% the same.

01:41:49.591 --> 01:42:00.224
And all the attributes like, you know, color your hair, eyes, you know, skin color, whatever, are just attributes.

01:42:00.504 --> 01:42:03.107
Accidents in the classical term, you know?

01:42:04.549 --> 01:42:05.870
Yeah.

01:42:07.692 --> 01:42:08.914
So we spent so much time.

01:42:08.934 --> 01:42:17.404
We have also in the White House, who's totally oblivious of these things, but he's, you know, he's promoting them.

01:42:17.857 --> 01:42:19.760
causing all kinds of havoc in our country.

01:42:20.501 --> 01:42:20.601
Yeah.

01:42:20.621 --> 01:42:22.363
Well, we should go in the other direction.

01:42:22.564 --> 01:42:36.864
Anyway, so the whole, I think, as you were suggesting, it provides a whole, an array of different ways of looking at mestizaje.

01:42:37.165 --> 01:42:41.451
There's sort of the juridical basis for it.

01:42:42.427 --> 01:42:43.548
international law.

01:42:45.751 --> 01:42:48.654
There's the genetic, the DNA.

01:42:49.655 --> 01:43:01.407
You can look at something people who maybe didn't even know they were Indian, you know, might look at their DNA and they find out, oh damn, you know, my grandparents were both apaches, you know.

01:43:01.688 --> 01:43:02.368
What does that make me?

01:43:04.170 --> 01:43:05.191
A quarter apache.

01:43:05.672 --> 01:43:10.577
And so you have that, and then you have the

01:43:11.063 --> 01:43:16.372
maybe theoretical or philosophical way of looking at it, you know?

01:43:18.796 --> 01:43:34.202
So there's all this, and maybe there's some other, you know, something I haven't thought about, or maybe we've mentioned it, but... Well, I think another one, too, is the sort of spiritual...

01:43:35.397 --> 01:43:37.280
That's not the right word.

01:43:39.584 --> 01:43:52.624
Theoretical, maybe, way of looking at it, you know, which goes beyond just the DNA, but, you know, where you begin to live a native life.

01:43:53.886 --> 01:44:02.299
I don't mean like, you know, you go on a reservation, but your orientation to the environment, to interact

01:44:05.873 --> 01:44:28.810
wildlife you know all those kind of things come into play if you're an indigenous person right right it's different yeah if you're if you're an indigenous person you act differently yeah okay um but it raises all kinds of questions like well do i have to change my way of

01:44:30.292 --> 01:44:33.956
What about my kids?

01:44:33.976 --> 01:44:35.838
Are they going to think I'm crazy?

01:44:37.540 --> 01:44:42.165
Or are my kids going to tell me, why are you so back?

01:44:42.286 --> 01:44:48.292
Why aren't you becoming or living like an indigenous person, like a native person?

01:44:49.093 --> 01:44:49.714
What does that mean?

01:44:52.717 --> 01:44:57.683
In terms of an existential...

01:44:58.135 --> 01:45:00.079
exist.

01:45:01.100 --> 01:45:10.878
There are existential consequences when you recognize that you're an indigenous person.

01:45:13.583 --> 01:45:17.711
So where do you go from that?

01:45:19.153 --> 01:45:20.616
Yeah, or

01:45:20.866 --> 01:45:34.840
It sounds like maybe the tension is how do you live that kind of life in a society that is not, that is practically antithetical to that, right?

01:45:35.921 --> 01:45:40.785
How do you orient yourself within that sphere?

01:45:40.806 --> 01:45:44.469
That's what's so beautiful going on right now in terms of demographics.

01:45:46.211 --> 01:45:50.535
Why do white Americans, or many of them,

01:45:50.887 --> 01:45:52.369
Why are they going crazy?

01:45:53.290 --> 01:45:54.451
Why are they shooting up people?

01:45:54.591 --> 01:45:59.497
That's why the Identifying Native 2020 is important.

01:46:01.680 --> 01:46:03.742
Well, I think so.

01:46:03.822 --> 01:46:14.515
I think that's almost like another way of looking at it where there are some

01:46:15.170 --> 01:46:18.495
good consequences of recognizing that you're native.

01:46:18.515 --> 01:46:31.315
I mean, there's political and so forth, and in terms of maybe housing or educational programs or whatever, just like affirmative action had some impact, and it's still having some impact.

01:46:34.239 --> 01:46:35.802
So it's good to be native.

01:46:38.706 --> 01:46:39.728
But it has consequences.

01:46:40.128 --> 01:46:41.891
You're absolutely right.

01:46:41.971 --> 01:46:42.612
It has consequences.

01:46:43.013 --> 01:47:11.518
yeah um so i think we were kind of before we you were talking about the the treaty of guadalupe hidalgo and and that kind of insight that you had um while you were working on your law degree um i think i was i had asked you about your earliest kind of memories of mistisaje and you were talking about your family and

01:47:11.988 --> 01:47:17.376
you know, this idea that to be indigenous was something bad or, you know.

01:47:17.857 --> 01:47:22.624
Yeah, it wasn't something that you went around and talking about it.

01:47:22.985 --> 01:47:32.299
I remember like going downtown with my grandmother on the, you know, the bus went right down our street, Ray Street in San Antonio.

01:47:35.243 --> 01:47:41.252
And there was a, of course, there was the separation of races, you know,

01:47:42.413 --> 01:47:43.514
It was an apartheid.

01:47:43.574 --> 01:47:45.617
It wasn't even a tripod.

01:47:45.637 --> 01:47:46.838
It was like quadruped.

01:47:47.879 --> 01:47:53.506
Because, you know, the whites could take all the seats because they were white.

01:47:54.927 --> 01:48:02.796
And rather than walk, the whites going in the back, they would stand in the front if there were no seats.

01:48:03.878 --> 01:48:06.881
Because they wanted to sit where those people were.

01:48:07.542 --> 01:48:07.662
Right.

01:48:09.751 --> 01:48:23.012
what do you call it, the pecking order was blacks were like kind of mixed, and then Mexicans, and then Native people, you know, Indians.

01:48:24.074 --> 01:48:27.620
So everybody could sit down except the Indians.

01:48:27.840 --> 01:48:29.683
There weren't any overseas left.

01:48:30.102 --> 01:48:31.984
You know, that's the way it was.

01:48:32.004 --> 01:48:33.726
This is in San Antonio?

01:48:33.746 --> 01:48:34.848
In San Antonio, you know.

01:48:35.288 --> 01:48:36.229
Interesting.

01:48:37.171 --> 01:48:43.198
It was, yeah, I mean, I used to go to the Majestic Theater and other ones.

01:48:43.218 --> 01:48:48.684
And except for the Mexican theater, which anybody could go in and watch movies.

01:48:48.724 --> 01:48:51.688
But the white ones, you had to go in the back door.

01:48:53.761 --> 01:48:54.261
upstairs.

01:48:58.406 --> 01:49:04.171
So blacks and Mexicanos would have to go on the other entrance.

01:49:07.334 --> 01:49:12.359
So that's not very conducive to saying that you're Indian.

01:49:13.560 --> 01:49:21.388
And of course there's also, I learned this later on, but there was also, and that's

01:49:23.933 --> 01:49:46.904
say, but there was also laws or court cases which established the notion that Mexicans were white, you know, again without necessarily looking at the consequences in terms of the theoretical system.

01:49:51.610 --> 01:49:53.873
So that whole notion of

01:49:59.877 --> 01:50:09.829
did play in the positive notion or positive effects on Mexican-Americans.

01:50:11.351 --> 01:50:19.901
It didn't mean a hell of a lot in terms of the actual behavior of whites or Americanos.

01:50:20.041 --> 01:50:24.466
But yeah, we were generally considered white.

01:50:24.526 --> 01:50:29.192
You could cite cases where, you know,

01:50:30.050 --> 01:50:36.517
Yeah, there's a... I don't know if you're familiar with Ian Haney Lopez, his work.

01:50:37.078 --> 01:50:38.780
He's at UC Berkeley.

01:50:39.581 --> 01:50:45.187
Yeah, he's got a pretty well-known book called The Wi-Fi Log that kind of covers some of that.

01:50:48.051 --> 01:50:49.232
Yeah, interesting.

01:50:49.272 --> 01:50:53.297
So... The Messisa has stuff.

01:50:54.838 --> 01:50:55.399
Um...

01:50:55.919 --> 01:51:25.487
A couple of things, maybe, I mean, I don't know if you would agree with any of this, but some of the things that have been kind of coming up in my other interviews, like my mom, who I interviewed, remembers her dad, my grandfather, telling them we're mestizos, but to be proud of your indigenous part, right?

01:51:25.906 --> 01:51:30.411
And this would be like in the 50s that this would be going on.

01:51:30.431 --> 01:51:43.884
And then there were some other like similar stories about having kind of an understanding of it from being in church.

01:51:45.225 --> 01:51:50.270
And, you know, particularly with like the image of the Virgen de Guadalupe.

01:51:50.310 --> 01:51:55.896
And then there was another

01:51:56.365 --> 01:52:20.750
another interview I did where the person was kind of explaining that, you know, this idea of mestizaje is not, it's not necessarily something that comes out of the Chicano movement, but it's like this kind of general kind of understanding within the Mexican American community.

01:52:21.851 --> 01:52:25.815
And then part of it comes from, you know, this,

01:52:26.555 --> 01:52:43.637
that a lot of the Chicanos or the Mexican-Americans of the 60s are still really connected with people or family that experienced the revolution in Mexico.

01:52:44.979 --> 01:52:55.633
And when Mesizaje starts becoming kind of more and more pronounced as part of this Mexican national ideology...

01:52:56.930 --> 01:53:05.462
So, I mean, I don't know if you agree with any of that or if any of that resonates or not.

01:53:06.384 --> 01:53:11.551
My experience was primarily that we didn't talk about it.

01:53:12.513 --> 01:53:17.680
I think we all kind of understood it, but it wasn't a topic around the table.

01:53:18.061 --> 01:53:21.526
Especially in our household.

01:53:24.510 --> 01:53:25.772
It wasn't until...

01:53:25.938 --> 01:53:46.789
Certainly, like I said, toward the end of the 60s with the Crusade for Justice and all this, that the whole concept even came, I think, really became like a dominant underlying factor in what Chicanismo is about.

01:53:48.091 --> 01:53:51.135
I think we're still discovering what Chicanismo is about.

01:53:51.453 --> 01:54:18.051
But I think, from my standpoint, what makes Chicanismo different and an underlying force in Chicanismo and in how our direction should be going, and I think it inevitably will go if it

01:54:22.553 --> 01:54:32.754
that we have to recognize that we can't just give lip service, so to speak, to our indigenous background.

01:54:33.837 --> 01:54:37.845
It has to become a living part of

01:54:44.525 --> 01:54:49.250
and become conscious.

01:54:50.512 --> 01:55:11.376
In fact, this evening I'm going to a monthly gathering of hombres who are indigenous and they live that life at an ideological level, intellectually

01:55:11.677 --> 01:55:14.040
spiritually, you know.

01:55:15.622 --> 01:55:17.164
Are you getting hungry?

01:55:17.665 --> 01:55:21.289
I have a little indigestion.

01:55:21.930 --> 01:55:23.512
I just took some chunks.

01:55:23.813 --> 01:55:27.137
Oh, I have some, what is it, Pepsi?

01:55:29.240 --> 01:55:31.142
I forget what it's called.

01:55:31.282 --> 01:55:35.107
It's probably just, I like overdid it on coffee today or something.

01:55:35.127 --> 01:55:35.868
Oh, yeah, I'm sorry.

01:55:36.529 --> 01:55:37.410
No, it's okay.

01:55:38.111 --> 01:55:39.173
Yeah.

01:55:39.193 --> 01:55:39.473
Um...

01:55:40.634 --> 01:56:10.573
So it's a, as I say, my sense is that with respect to the demographics and how things are changing in this country, as I point out in the blueprint, not only if we don't do something about really recognizing the challenges that we face as we become more and more of a majority,

01:56:11.684 --> 01:56:40.459
somebody else is still going to be telling us what to do I don't think I put it that bluntly but we definitely have to have reach a point where we can begin to take leadership roles yeah and I I appreciate what you were saying about Chicanismo that it's still kind of like evolving right and we're um

01:56:40.743 --> 01:57:00.692
that it's not something that's completely settled yet, but I always think of it as, and especially like what, what was revealed in the, the kind of early days of the Chicano movement is this, uh, demand to the,

01:57:01.162 --> 01:57:14.530
for self-determination right um so i think that's you know that's one of those kind of like principle axioms of we didn't we didn't act on it yeah again it was kind of like

01:57:15.674 --> 01:57:25.007
It was a sort of an intellectual trip, you know, that started out.

01:57:25.948 --> 01:57:28.211
But we never really addressed it.

01:57:28.591 --> 01:57:29.993
We didn't have, like, SNAP.

01:57:30.033 --> 01:57:38.745
We didn't have a lot of people in scholarship roles to really, like, look at and say, what does this really mean, you know?

01:57:39.974 --> 01:58:09.137
to what extent do we have to change our own outlook on life if that's really the case if we are really indigenous people do we focus on that or do we continue being sort of indigenous and be mostly Hispanic and you know follow the route of you know I guess hundreds of thousands before then who had you know gone into school and become you know

01:58:09.809 --> 01:58:13.234
middle class or whatever and missed the whole boat.

01:58:13.574 --> 01:58:21.325
Not because of their fault or anything like that, but just the nature of the society at that time.

01:58:21.345 --> 01:58:29.556
Yeah, and I think some people, I hear even people who are members of SMAP who

01:58:30.177 --> 01:58:40.347
You know, anytime a proposition like that comes up, it's always kind of like dismissed or like straw manned, right?

01:58:40.367 --> 01:58:42.089
Like, oh, well, we can't.

01:58:42.590 --> 01:58:48.035
There's no way we can possibly all become indigenous again, right?

01:58:48.055 --> 01:58:51.279
Like we have a, we're in a society.

01:58:51.459 --> 01:58:52.780
You're missing the boat.

01:58:52.800 --> 01:58:54.021
Well, yeah.

01:58:54.041 --> 01:58:59.627
And I think, you know, it's funny to me because to me, it's very kind of

01:59:01.396 --> 01:59:13.309
I don't want to say short-sighted, but kind of short-sighted that, like, you're so locked into this kind of colonial mindset that you cannot see your way out of it, you know?

01:59:15.191 --> 01:59:30.508
Well, it sounds like someone who thinks like that, you know, so-and-so, fulano tal, you know, is missing...

01:59:30.775 --> 01:59:40.748
the whole issue because it is that very question of what does it mean that I'm indigenous?

01:59:41.529 --> 01:59:43.451
That is a philosophical question.

01:59:43.651 --> 01:59:44.192
Right.

01:59:45.734 --> 01:59:51.081
Because just as you might ask, why are we here?

01:59:51.101 --> 01:59:52.442
Why did I come on this earth?

01:59:52.903 --> 01:59:53.424
Things like that.

01:59:54.044 --> 01:59:54.725
Huge questions.

01:59:56.227 --> 01:59:59.331
What does it mean that I'm indigenous?

02:00:00.458 --> 02:00:06.904
Do I just continue being Hispanic?

02:00:10.027 --> 02:00:12.970
Whatever that means, because to me it's hollow.

02:00:13.030 --> 02:00:14.351
There's nothing there.

02:00:16.033 --> 02:00:26.703
In order to be really Hispanic, you'd have to adopt what was going on in Spain to be the most extreme, let's say.

02:00:27.724 --> 02:00:30.347
But we're not Hispanioles.

02:00:30.935 --> 02:00:32.477
We're not Argentinian.

02:00:32.517 --> 02:00:34.561
We're not even Mexicans as such.

02:00:34.861 --> 02:00:36.223
We're something totally different.

02:00:38.226 --> 02:00:47.540
Part of it is the fact that we have had to cope with this country.

02:00:47.560 --> 02:00:47.841
Yeah.

02:00:48.502 --> 02:00:52.308
I've said that at this conference that I've been to twice now.

02:00:53.870 --> 02:00:59.018
The first time that I went there a couple of years ago,

02:00:59.943 --> 02:01:25.839
I made the point that we are distinct or distinguished in the sense that we're not only Mexican origin and Hispanic origin, that whole mezcla, but we've also had to live in the Valley of the Beast and survive, but we've acquired attributes of being Anglo, whether we like it or not.

02:01:25.960 --> 02:01:28.363
We're stuck with it.

02:01:29.643 --> 02:01:43.575
Yeah, and that actually brings me to maybe my final question for the interview and kind of takes us back to Chicano Manifesto.

02:01:44.235 --> 02:01:59.548
I'm looking for a part in here and I can't find it at the moment, but there was, I think,

02:02:00.001 --> 02:02:10.016
It's in one of the first two chapters where you kind of talk about... To me, it sounds very much kind of Vasconcelos-like.

02:02:10.537 --> 02:02:11.758
Vasconcelosian?

02:02:11.939 --> 02:02:13.240
I don't know what the word would be.

02:02:14.843 --> 02:02:27.882
But there's a part in there where you kind of talk about how the Chicano, because of this kind of... You know, he's not...

02:02:28.047 --> 02:02:29.429
He's not Mexican.

02:02:29.570 --> 02:02:31.934
He's not fully American.

02:02:31.954 --> 02:02:33.496
He's a new thing, right?

02:02:34.418 --> 02:02:48.942
And there's a comment that you make that this is not only kind of like a new, heralding a new type of outlook on the world, but one that is also...

02:02:49.478 --> 02:03:13.157
like beneficial for the rest of humanity or it offers some kind of gift to the rest of humanity I know what you're talking about it's kind of the far out things I think that I talk about there's a lot of other things but

02:03:13.137 --> 02:03:16.342
I think I've said something along those lines recently.

02:03:16.382 --> 02:03:19.247
I think it was in the Cuernavaca paper.

02:03:21.070 --> 02:03:23.333
I should send it to you.

02:03:23.674 --> 02:03:23.774
Sure.

02:03:23.794 --> 02:03:35.192
But the... It might have been also like prescient in terms of where we are now, where I am now with the blueprint.

02:03:35.212 --> 02:03:38.537
And that is that...

02:03:40.964 --> 02:03:52.200
this is maybe far out and it's very self-serving, whatever, but we can help save this continent, you know?

02:03:52.220 --> 02:03:55.405
And I think it's our role, right?

02:03:55.425 --> 02:04:01.214
That, because we understand the whole picture.

02:04:01.234 --> 02:04:07.683
We know the Anglos, you know, better than they do themselves, anyways.

02:04:09.125 --> 02:04:10.347
But what we don't know,

02:04:11.187 --> 02:04:13.450
is our indigenous background.

02:04:13.470 --> 02:04:22.340
And we haven't fully recognized it, let alone recognize the sense of accepting it, let alone understanding it, right?

02:04:22.400 --> 02:04:24.723
There's a difference.

02:04:26.385 --> 02:04:32.693
But we also have a connection, and I pointed out now two times in Guadalajara.

02:04:33.974 --> 02:04:40.722
We also have a unique connection with Mexico and the rest of Latin America, okay?

02:04:42.457 --> 02:05:02.767
And I think the sooner that Mexico realizes that and starts working with Mexican-Americans here in this country as an indigenous sovereign nation, that things might start to change.

02:05:05.170 --> 02:05:06.372
There might be hell to pay.

02:05:06.757 --> 02:05:18.741
in some sense, but I guess I put it that the future of America is in our hands.

02:05:19.447 --> 02:05:34.922
That's one of the reasons that the whole idea of a 50-year cycle came to my head and not doing what we did the last 50 years, which is not much at this level.

02:05:36.464 --> 02:05:48.255
Really thinking through all these different issues, our identity, our need to have a common voice, not have just one person out there

02:05:51.577 --> 02:06:20.706
it because you know he can't be the Mexican American candidate he has to be candid for everybody at some level he can talk about issues like immigration and so forth that affect we're not immigrants he has to be saying that we're not immigrants I don't think he's I haven't heard him that often but he hasn't come on and said Mexicans are not immigrants you know

02:06:21.462 --> 02:06:24.865
I haven't heard anybody in politics say that.

02:06:24.885 --> 02:06:27.207
No, no, no.

02:06:27.227 --> 02:06:31.671
Um, but it's, you know, at some point we had to start seeing it.

02:06:32.131 --> 02:06:32.311
Yeah.

02:06:32.331 --> 02:06:50.707
That's why the other thing about, uh, uh, besides our identity is to have our, what I call our own voice, you know, have a narrative where we all kind of recognize it and we're willing to say, yeah, I'm indigenous and, uh, what, so what, it can't, you know, it can't.

02:06:50.727 --> 02:06:50.907
Yeah.

02:06:50.987 --> 02:06:51.047
Um,

02:06:52.917 --> 02:06:58.766
But I think in some sense that is, that's my, that's my story and I'm sticking to it as they say.

02:06:58.786 --> 02:06:58.987
Yeah.

02:06:59.447 --> 02:07:00.769
Well, and I appreciate it.

02:07:00.809 --> 02:07:13.770
There's, there's parts in, I think it's the Chicano nation chapter where you talk about kind of these regional differences between people who are, who are one, right?

02:07:14.972 --> 02:07:20.781
And how, you know, in some ways, like there's a beauty to it because

02:07:21.436 --> 02:07:36.973
we recognize that we have different, you know, that we're not all the same, but it also is problematic because then it causes these kind of like needless divisions, right?

02:07:36.993 --> 02:07:50.228
And you talk about it just not only in terms of geography, but also in the kind of words that we use to refer to each other or to distinguish ourselves.

02:07:50.562 --> 02:07:56.407
So I'm going to look some more into that particular stuff.

02:07:57.448 --> 02:08:20.350
But the other kind of question that I wanted to ask you about that particular kind of idea that you had regarding Chicanos being this kind of conduit for, you know, changes, massive kind of changes in the way that we live our lives

02:08:20.650 --> 02:08:24.236
in this hemisphere, right?

02:08:24.636 --> 02:08:33.771
One question is, is that as Chicanos in particular, or are you talking about like kind of just indigenous people in general?

02:08:36.075 --> 02:08:37.697
That's a good point or question.

02:08:37.717 --> 02:08:44.548
I would say that...

02:08:45.203 --> 02:08:55.815
Again, where my mind is right now is that we have to recognize that we're indigenous above all.

02:08:57.096 --> 02:09:03.403
And not everybody's going to accept that, and that's fine.

02:09:06.366 --> 02:09:14.535
But we have to have a common understanding of our indigeneity.

02:09:15.325 --> 02:09:41.113
And that can only come through, you know, the discussion, interaction, having people that, you know, others will look up to, you know, their scholars or their maybe politicians, perhaps community leaders and so forth who get it, you know, who realize the implications

02:09:44.992 --> 02:10:00.426
And that's one of the underlying reasons for the blueprint is that, and I've said this several times now, there is a group that we're working together to build out this idea.

02:10:02.627 --> 02:10:13.497
Because if we don't do something, I just hate to think, and I said something like this earlier, 50 years from now, somebody's going to say, look back and say, no, she don't know how to

02:10:15.198 --> 02:10:16.439
What the hell were they thinking about?

02:10:17.240 --> 02:10:19.403
We're still in the same place we were 50 years ago.

02:10:21.846 --> 02:10:32.959
Famous term from the Chicano movement days, especially the entire Vietnam movement, chale, you know, chale.

02:10:33.019 --> 02:10:45.154
That was a perfect way of expression, chale, you know, with all this, you know, with the Vietnam War, with, you know, Chicanos being thrown in his father, you know.

02:10:46.045 --> 02:10:54.196
I think it's time for Charlie with this kind of like just kind of going with the flow.

02:10:55.238 --> 02:10:56.239
We can't do that anymore.

02:10:56.399 --> 02:11:01.086
I can't imagine 50 years from now.

02:11:01.106 --> 02:11:03.749
I don't want to imagine 50 years from now being in the same boat.

02:11:04.450 --> 02:11:07.234
Yeah.

02:11:08.336 --> 02:11:11.300
And we have so much potential.

02:11:13.262 --> 02:11:15.225
There's 40 million people already here.

02:11:16.049 --> 02:11:28.163
And if we unify with all the native people, other native peoples, with Mexico, and all the tribal people that are there, just think about it, you know?

02:11:28.824 --> 02:11:29.986
Yeah.

02:11:31.668 --> 02:11:37.154
Let me, I'm going to stop because I need to use the restroom.

02:11:37.194 --> 02:11:42.921
But I do have one question that I wanted to, hey, stop that.

02:11:42.941 --> 02:11:43.882
There you go.

02:11:43.902 --> 02:11:45.364
I don't think I did it, no.

02:11:46.593 --> 02:11:52.546
my own recollection.

02:11:53.087 --> 02:11:59.100
So as I was reading this, I just recently reread

02:11:59.502 --> 02:12:05.871
Anzalúa's Borderlands, because I'm also going to be talking about that in my dissertation.

02:12:06.192 --> 02:12:13.863
And I kind of noticed like a lot of what she says is kind of what you're saying in here.

02:12:14.924 --> 02:12:19.050
And I'm curious, I don't know if you've ever read that book or not.

02:12:19.771 --> 02:12:20.613
You've never read it?

02:12:20.893 --> 02:12:20.953
No.

02:12:21.423 --> 02:12:25.392
Yeah, I was going to ask if you had any kind of comments.

02:12:25.412 --> 02:12:31.727
If you had any comments about kind of the, because she makes similar kinds of claims, right?

02:12:31.787 --> 02:12:34.573
She read my book.

02:12:34.593 --> 02:12:35.696
Probably, right?

02:12:35.796 --> 02:12:36.978
That's what I'm wondering.

02:12:37.560 --> 02:12:37.660
Yeah.

02:12:37.808 --> 02:12:43.836
But the thing is, I don't remember her making any citations to your book.

02:12:43.857 --> 02:12:44.778
I'm not surprised.

02:12:44.798 --> 02:12:45.879
I'm not surprised.

02:12:47.241 --> 02:12:49.164
But, yeah, okay.

02:12:49.184 --> 02:12:53.971
Well, that's really kind of all I had to ask about that.

02:12:55.233 --> 02:12:59.158
In a way, if it does sound like something that I might have said...

02:12:59.965 --> 02:13:04.372
It's an idea, so it's not, you know, I can't copyright it.

02:13:04.392 --> 02:13:04.533
Right.

02:13:04.613 --> 02:13:08.119
Only if it's a quote from my book and they don't attribute it.

02:13:09.040 --> 02:13:09.381
Yeah.

02:13:09.401 --> 02:13:10.863
Or something plagiarizes or whatever.

02:13:10.883 --> 02:13:18.075
Yeah, I could sue or something, but... Yeah, no, I just see... I want the ideas out, too, you know, so...

02:13:18.393 --> 02:13:41.121
Yeah, I see a lot of... Well, because she kind of uses a similar type of argument, which is that the Chicano... Well, really for her, it's a little more along the lines of like the... She calls it the mestiza consciousness, right?

02:13:41.201 --> 02:13:46.307
That there is a kind of unique perspective...

02:13:46.810 --> 02:14:13.245
That somebody, a Chicana from the border area is going to have about knowledge about the world and that this type of person, this type of person who thinks like this, who has this kind of like borderlands mentality is going to be the person that, you know, brings about these more positive changes.

02:14:13.646 --> 02:14:13.746
Yeah.

02:14:13.979 --> 02:14:21.511
So it's something that I kind of picked up because your book is out in 71.

02:14:21.772 --> 02:14:23.735
Is that right?

02:14:23.755 --> 02:14:30.005
Her book, I think she published in 80, like mid 80s.

02:14:31.327 --> 02:14:32.950
Well, it probably might have slipped into her.

02:14:33.250 --> 02:14:34.631
Yeah.

02:14:34.651 --> 02:14:37.214
Um, but okay.

02:14:38.275 --> 02:14:41.218
Yeah.

02:14:41.638 --> 02:14:46.883
So I just wanted to know if you had read her work and if you had any comments about it.

02:14:47.764 --> 02:14:52.269
Um, there's a lot of, a lot of stuff I've not read.

02:14:52.309 --> 02:14:56.072
I've wanted to, I've read a few things from, you know, some excerpts and that sort of thing.

02:14:57.254 --> 02:15:01.738
Um, so yeah, I have an idea of her thinking.

02:15:02.225 --> 02:15:21.604
What I think is, I'm driving at is to look at some of the issues that she's talking about and others are talking about, not from just the paradigm of, you know, Chicanese or Chicana Indigena.

02:15:23.066 --> 02:15:28.671
That's a term I think that she used or somebody used of...

02:15:29.073 --> 02:15:44.793
I just saw something recently where the writer Jenny Luna sort of came up with the term of Chicana Indigena.

02:15:47.317 --> 02:15:56.008
So my reaction to that is that what the blueprint is about is all of us looking at Chicanismo

02:16:01.321 --> 02:16:02.042
male or female.

02:16:04.806 --> 02:16:15.500
Not even talking about binary genders, the type of things, you know, where people who hit somewhere in the spectrum of gender want to have their day in court, so to speak.

02:16:16.121 --> 02:16:20.406
But then we look at it from terms of a statehood, nationhood.

02:16:21.327 --> 02:16:29.458
And whoever wants to, you know, put in their oars, so to speak, can do so and should do so.

02:16:29.939 --> 02:16:30.079
Mm-hmm.

02:16:30.397 --> 02:16:47.224
but let's not get stuck in, you know, questions about binary gender or, you know, certain politics or just ideology because there's a lot of room in this whole thing of the Chicanismo.

02:16:48.265 --> 02:16:53.113
And the more that we look at it in terms of, you know, the future,

02:16:53.617 --> 02:17:00.367
and where we're going as a people as opposed to just being concerned with one aspect of it.

02:17:02.310 --> 02:17:17.312
We should all have a voice that speaks to these issues as well or that lets the concept of whatever you're coming from be what informs you in terms of what the future looks like.

02:17:18.454 --> 02:17:23.421
Yeah, and I think part of it is like a distinction between

02:17:24.616 --> 02:17:49.847
identity and like self-knowledge or knowledge of of yourself or your community um because i think like the identity stuff gets you into you know like you were talking about the these divisions right these divisions where you want to you want to distinguish yourself i'm i'm this i'm that

02:17:50.367 --> 02:18:05.669
And that's not to say that identity is not important, but that it is not just about distinguishing yourself, but about understanding who you are, who your people are.

02:18:05.789 --> 02:18:07.712
And I think those are two different things.

02:18:08.713 --> 02:18:18.467
And my worry about, you know, all these different kinds of Chicanismos is that it takes away from that

02:18:18.903 --> 02:18:22.907
what I think is a more important question about understanding who we are.

02:18:24.328 --> 02:18:34.438
Um, but any who is, uh, is there anything you'd like to, I mean, I'm pretty much kind of done with my question.

02:18:35.019 --> 02:18:36.640
Is there anything you want to add?

02:18:37.381 --> 02:18:38.142
Oh, wow.

02:18:38.162 --> 02:18:40.244
Um, yeah.

02:18:41.645 --> 02:18:46.750
Is there anything you want to add as a closing or,

02:18:48.097 --> 02:19:13.742
I just want to reemphasize the point about the blueprint and that I see it as a way of coming up, evolving, creating, just building on all the experience we've had to establish what our identity is.

02:19:15.303 --> 02:19:17.125
And in the broad sense of identity,

02:19:17.830 --> 02:19:46.909
in relationship to where we are right now, where we're living right now in the United States, and how we relate to other peoples of indigenous background, which talks to the alliances that are recommended or suggested in the blueprint, and how we address these through literature, to the arts, through our education,

02:19:47.227 --> 02:20:10.494
and so on, so that we do begin to recognize, not just recognize the potential we have, because we're not talking about having more votes and that sort of thing, but preparing ourselves for a point in time that's going to be pretty quick in relative terms.

02:20:13.278 --> 02:20:17.082
Ten years from now, 20 years from now, when we start to become majority and not only

02:20:18.158 --> 02:20:30.030
certain states, but regions and the whole country in alliance with other tribal people that we have to prepare ourselves.

02:20:31.111 --> 02:20:40.600
We can't just let things happen and expect the powers that be to give up their powers easily.

02:20:41.541 --> 02:20:48.047
So that's why I say that we have a lot of responsibility

02:20:48.922 --> 02:20:52.686
you know, at the same time toward the future.

02:20:52.706 --> 02:20:55.930
And I'm just talking about our own people.

02:20:56.711 --> 02:21:09.026
But whoever is, you know, coming, you know, further on who are going to be a mezcla also, the Angles are going to become mestizos.

02:21:09.046 --> 02:21:10.307
It's impossible for them not to.

02:21:11.388 --> 02:21:11.669
You know?

02:21:13.411 --> 02:21:14.592
I haven't even talked about that.

02:21:18.773 --> 02:21:29.878
I mean, technically most of them already are.

02:21:29.958 --> 02:21:30.760
All right.

02:21:30.780 --> 02:21:32.243
Yeah.

02:21:33.707 --> 02:21:34.208
All right.

02:21:34.288 --> 02:21:36.473
Well, thank you.

02:21:37.816 --> 02:21:38.277
Yeah.

02:21:38.297 --> 02:21:40.562
I'm going to go ahead and stop this.
