00:01.280 --> 00:07.640
Words and pictures, or possibly words versus pictures, with particular reference to science

00:07.640 --> 00:14.620
fiction as the subject of our discussion today, with me are Theodore Sturgeon, whose stature

00:14.620 --> 00:16.760
as a writer we have noted in the past.

00:17.300 --> 00:21.320
His most recent collection of stories is called Visions and Venturers.

00:22.400 --> 00:27.200
Lloyd Bigel, a writer currently on the faculty at Eastern Michigan University, his stories

00:27.200 --> 00:31.820
have appeared widely in various science fiction magazines, including the New Omni.

00:32.660 --> 00:35.420
And he has had some fourteen books published.

00:36.420 --> 00:42.360
And James R. Oddbert, an illustrator whose work is accompanied stories by Theodore Sturgeon,

00:42.440 --> 00:48.440
including the New Visions and Venturers, and any number of other science fiction writers.

00:49.300 --> 00:57.300
He hails from Minneapolis, where I understand Gordon Dixon also comes from.

00:57.660 --> 01:02.880
Gordon Dixon's new book, Pro, was illustrated by Mr. Oddbert.

01:03.700 --> 01:09.600
Jim, what in your view is the role of the illustrator, particularly in science fiction?

01:09.800 --> 01:12.620
Are you a crutch for the author or an equal?

01:13.400 --> 01:19.360
Well, not an equal, but I certainly hope not a crutch.

01:21.640 --> 01:27.020
The illustrator, I feel the illustrator should embellish the story.

01:27.940 --> 01:36.000
He adds to it, gives it more richness and depth with the illustrations, particularly if he can

01:36.000 --> 01:45.740
work closely with the author so that he can let you see things that the author did not

01:45.740 --> 01:49.860
describe, but had in mind when he was doing the story.

01:50.100 --> 01:52.480
I mentioned Gordon Dixon.

01:53.060 --> 01:57.660
Was he influential in getting you started, let's say, in illustrating science fiction?

01:59.100 --> 02:04.280
Well he was influential in getting me into the book illustration part of it.

02:04.280 --> 02:09.620
I've been doing illustration for quite some time, but when I got into the books,

02:10.080 --> 02:15.140
Gordy was very influential in getting me started in book illustration.

02:15.500 --> 02:17.800
What other kinds of work have you done?

02:19.920 --> 02:29.400
My founding, my basis, was in industrial design, which actually works nicely in the illustration,

02:29.620 --> 02:31.960
particularly the hardware and the technical end of it.

02:32.640 --> 02:37.560
Do you find it difficult on occasion to do something to accompany a story?

02:40.460 --> 02:51.240
Not really. More it's difficult finding the real feel of the story and doing the illustration to

02:51.240 --> 02:59.140
fit the feel. The things are not difficult. It's the feeling that it's harder to find and to bring

02:59.140 --> 02:59.680
to the process.

03:01.100 --> 03:08.940
There have been very few really great illustrators down through the years. My own experience,

03:09.140 --> 03:15.120
I'm reminded of NC Wyeth and people like that illustrating Stevenson and other writers,

03:15.840 --> 03:23.440
but their names simply don't stand out. I guess one reason is that not too many of the older

03:23.440 --> 03:30.260
books actually contained illustrations or very few illustrations. So often today one gets the

03:30.260 --> 03:40.300
impression that the illustration is an aid to the child or perhaps the semi-literate adult in

03:40.300 --> 03:44.560
getting him over the problem of reading. How do you feel about that, Mr. Sturgeon?

03:45.860 --> 03:52.980
In an interesting time, we haven't had any illustrations at all. Earlier, however,

03:52.980 --> 03:58.220
they did. I can remember a turn of the century books that always had a Francis piece and often

03:58.220 --> 04:02.620
then these very careful stealing gravings and woodcuts and things like that all the way through.

04:03.540 --> 04:08.620
We got away from that. We're getting back to it again. And more and more you'll find interior

04:08.620 --> 04:14.720
illustrations in books. Some publishers and editors like Byron Price in New York are doing

04:14.720 --> 04:19.640
a whole series of novels which are almost half and half illustration and copy, which is very

04:19.640 --> 04:25.580
interesting. I wonder how to hand a palm to Mr. Albert here. He's Jim Albert. He really and truly

04:25.580 --> 04:32.820
reads what he illustrates. It happens that this copy of Vision's Inventure has fell into my hands

04:32.820 --> 04:38.520
last night. For the very first time, the local B. Dalton bookstore made a special effort and got

04:38.520 --> 04:43.680
them out pre-publication. It'll probably be out generally next week. But they got into stock. How

04:43.680 --> 04:49.900
I don't know. I've tried to do this myself and failed. And the manager down there is really on

04:49.900 --> 04:56.060
top of it. And so I had my first look at it and at Jim's drawings last night. I was very, very

04:56.060 --> 05:03.160
pleased. He clearly has carefully read each story. And as he said, the feel of it. He's gotten that

05:03.160 --> 05:08.000
over very well indeed. Where I write horror, he's got a horror drawing where it tends to be more

05:08.000 --> 05:13.780
mechanistic in a computer story, for example. It's neat and it's laid out. And you're immediately

05:13.780 --> 05:20.460
get the feel of the story. You did not work with him in the preparation? No. In this case, no, I

05:20.460 --> 05:25.500
haven't. I've been all across the spectrum with artists working, sometimes not knowing who they

05:25.500 --> 05:30.620
are. Some of them I never did find out who they were. And in other cases, I've written stories

05:30.620 --> 05:35.880
from a painting. An editor will buy a painting he likes and say, hey, I got no story to go with

05:35.880 --> 05:42.100
this. I want to get into that subject in just a moment. But let me ask you first of all, Lloyd

05:42.100 --> 05:49.020
Beggel, do you have a feeling sometimes that illustrations have a tendency to drive out good

05:49.020 --> 05:55.100
writing, perhaps? I had an interesting experience with a novel of mine called Delight That Never Was,

05:55.660 --> 06:02.180
which coincidentally is a novel about art. And the cover painting for the paperback book was done

06:02.180 --> 06:09.620
by Kelly Freese, who was excellent. And the scene that he drew for the cover painting does not occur

06:09.620 --> 06:15.900
in the book anywhere. But in that scene, he delineates one of the major themes of the novel

06:15.900 --> 06:21.140
beautifully. The cover could stand entirely by itself. It tells its own story, which is entirely

06:21.140 --> 06:26.900
different from the story of my novel. But it delineates the theme of the novel. And with the

06:26.900 --> 06:32.120
novel, of course, in conjunction, then it means something additional. Now, if he had done a series

06:32.120 --> 06:38.640
of interior drawings on that nature, the reader would have been horribly confused, because again,

06:38.840 --> 06:43.600
they would have nothing to do with the story, even if he caught the theme in some way of what the

06:43.600 --> 06:51.100
story was about. So in your view, it did add. It wasn't a... It did add. And in those circumstances,

06:51.100 --> 06:59.060
the cover, yes. You know, there's an interesting parallel. We in radio, all these years, have

06:59.060 --> 07:08.200
been convinced that it's an ideal medium for the imaginative, as opposed to, let's say, a film or

07:08.200 --> 07:21.080
television. In other words, you leave so much up to the imagination of the listener, and you don't

07:21.080 --> 07:25.080
see it. It can be done very well in radio, but they're ruined the minute you see it. Now,

07:26.040 --> 07:31.560
isn't this true to some degree of a science fiction story? The minute you illustrate it,

07:31.580 --> 07:36.900
you take away from the reader the opportunity to make a concept of his own.

07:37.580 --> 07:42.520
This is true. I say a picture is worth a thousand words, but sometimes the reader's imagination

07:42.520 --> 07:48.520
is worth ten thousand words. So it happens that way. Also, it works both ways as far as

07:49.040 --> 07:55.140
art and illustration. If you make a differentiation between the two, I have a French edition of my

07:55.140 --> 08:01.280
novel More Than Human, illustrated by a French artist, the name is Girard. The guy is an

08:01.280 --> 08:07.520
extraordinary artist. And the illustrations, the pictures in the book are good art, but poor

08:07.520 --> 08:12.880
illustration. I mean, they don't have that, as you said, quality of feel. Or the feel they have

08:12.880 --> 08:21.000
is not the same as the feel of the story. Once again, when you're illustrating a story,

08:21.460 --> 08:31.380
it's sometimes very important not to add too much to the story or give away the story, particularly

08:31.380 --> 08:40.260
in short stories. You have to be very careful not to give away the punchline or the end of the

08:40.260 --> 08:48.380
story in advance. There's one in Visions and Ventures that, after I read the story, the immediate

08:48.380 --> 08:55.900
illustration that sprung into my mind looked very nice and everything. And then I realized I couldn't

08:55.900 --> 09:05.180
do it because it would tell the punchline at the end of the story before it would just be

09:05.180 --> 09:12.800
anticlimactic when they read the story. Do you differentiate in your own mind between, as Mr.

09:12.900 --> 09:23.680
Sturgeon has said, a work of art and an illustration? No, no, I don't. An illustration can be a work

09:23.680 --> 09:33.940
of art. An illustration should be a work of art. Not can be, but it really should be. Not all works

09:33.940 --> 09:40.640
of arts are illustration, but a good illustration should be a work of art. I absolutely agree with

09:40.640 --> 09:47.140
you with that. The difference I made particularly is one in the net French book, struck me particularly

09:47.140 --> 09:54.740
because nobody could fault the man as an artist. His black and white are simply extraordinary.

09:55.100 --> 10:01.380
He used a combination of, I think, Fine Pen and Airbrush in black and white and simply amazing

10:01.380 --> 10:05.780
work that he did. But they were not good illustrations as far as the story was concerned.

10:07.400 --> 10:13.680
No, of course, the ones that you mentioned, Wyeth, for example, I remember he did a,

10:14.260 --> 10:18.260
do you remember Howard Pyle's book of pirates? And did Wyeth do those illustrations?

10:18.580 --> 10:18.780
I think so.

10:18.920 --> 10:22.700
They were gorgeous illustrations and real art. I know a question about it.

10:22.700 --> 10:36.900
Yeah, the way back when novels were first coming out and illustration was a part of it,

10:37.500 --> 10:44.580
I mean way back. Gustav Dorey was one of, and he's still referred to as an illustrator,

10:44.580 --> 10:55.540
but these are works of art and too many people, I don't think you can differentiate between artist

10:55.540 --> 11:06.380
and illustrator, not really. A good illustrator is an artist. Not all artists are good illustrators.

11:06.560 --> 11:10.920
Again, it's a subclass. You can have marvelous art that is not illustrator.

11:10.920 --> 11:14.760
That was just my point. In this case, a fine artist was not a good illustrator.

11:15.300 --> 11:21.720
Many times certain illustrations by a particular illustrator become very much identified

11:22.270 --> 11:28.040
with the story and with the character. I mean Dickens or Alice in Wonderland.

11:29.870 --> 11:32.300
Other illustrators have tried to illustrate them.

11:33.020 --> 11:35.480
Oh, no, Alice without Tony's illustrations.

11:35.880 --> 11:40.260
But to me, as an original, we'll probably always simply accompany that story.

11:40.920 --> 11:48.500
I really feel that a lot of that is that it's a great story which inspires the first artist to

11:48.500 --> 11:56.700
get their hands on it. And the definition of the identification is with the first man that does it.

11:57.880 --> 12:01.480
And if he does it properly, nobody else can do it.

12:01.920 --> 12:03.840
It is deserved to be repeated.

12:04.380 --> 12:04.540
No.

12:06.240 --> 12:16.580
Lloyd, Mr. Sturgeon, a moment ago mentioned this business of commissioning a story to go along

12:16.580 --> 12:23.700
with an already prepared illustration. And you've written about this in one of the introductions to

12:23.700 --> 12:29.200
your stories. What's your feeling about this? Do you think this is degrading the writer?

12:29.700 --> 12:32.480
I thought it was a challenge to try it. I've just done it once.

12:33.080 --> 12:36.640
I don't think I would like to write very much. I don't want to make my own pictures.

12:37.200 --> 12:42.740
Well, you come over to the other side of the field for a while. This is what we do all the time.

12:44.280 --> 12:48.920
I've always found it the same thing as a challenge. I've done it a number of times.

12:49.080 --> 12:52.880
As a matter of fact, one of the stories in Vision's Inventory is One Foot in the Grave.

12:54.120 --> 12:59.240
Weird Tales bought a cover. A very strange painting by Joe Pugnani.

13:00.520 --> 13:04.040
And nobody could make any sense of it. The editor had bought it because he liked it.

13:05.080 --> 13:11.000
I had the job of writing a story into it. It wasn't easy, but I got it all in.

13:12.400 --> 13:20.100
In this new book of yours, Vision's Inventurers, is the cover illustration done by you?

13:20.260 --> 13:25.060
It's done by a different person. I noticed that in the Gordon Dixon Pro, which I have in front of

13:25.060 --> 13:29.780
me, there again, the cover illustration is by someone else. Does that create problems?

13:30.620 --> 13:38.000
Yes, it does. Part of the reason that I do not do a lot of color work on partially colorblind.

13:39.320 --> 13:39.860
No kidding.

13:42.560 --> 13:47.760
And the balance of black and white is what I feel I do best and what I enjoy doing.

13:47.880 --> 13:50.040
You certainly do it well. There's no question about that.

13:50.040 --> 13:58.940
But the person that did the cover on Pro had never seen my black and white interiors when

13:58.940 --> 14:06.400
he did the cover. And as a result, it's particularly noticeable on the hero who's in the front and

14:06.400 --> 14:14.000
on the aliens in the background. Because Gordy and I worked very long and hard on trying to figure

14:14.000 --> 14:20.580
out just what the aliens looked like. And the cover alien is something entirely different.

14:20.740 --> 14:26.280
Well, I noticed the uniform on the man in there is different from the uniform that you have in

14:26.280 --> 14:34.100
wearing. So the cover, I suppose, is there to get you inside the story. And then once you're inside,

14:34.760 --> 14:38.500
the illustrator is going to have to be much closer to the story.

14:38.500 --> 14:46.180
You know, the thing is that the cover should be able to draw you in and truly reflect the story.

14:46.360 --> 14:50.320
Too often, the cover has nothing to do with the story.

14:51.660 --> 14:52.920
It's a grabber.

14:53.820 --> 15:00.860
That's essentially all they're attempting to do is to put something there that looks science,

15:00.860 --> 15:10.060
fictiony, that will grab your eye and make you pick it up and read it. And I really don't have any

15:10.060 --> 15:16.920
objections with them wanting to grab you and make you pick it up and read it. But I think they

15:16.920 --> 15:23.980
should be able to do it and truly reflect what's inside the book. I think that too many people

15:25.160 --> 15:32.560
sometimes get this really bad feeling because the cover and the book do not reflect one another.

15:34.000 --> 15:42.500
Gordon Dixon isn't here to defend himself, but I'd like to just use this as a kickoff for a

15:42.500 --> 15:47.000
discussion of this business of working the author, working together with the illustrator.

15:47.720 --> 15:55.040
In his book Pro, well right here on page two, for instance, he says,

15:55.280 --> 15:58.860
in her white slacks and shirt with only the Med Service badge for color on the pocket,

15:59.000 --> 16:04.480
she was a vibrant sight. Her hair was as black as a city and etc. And I look across the page at

16:04.480 --> 16:10.800
your illustration and to note that the Med Service badge is on her sleeve rather than her pocket.

16:10.800 --> 16:17.960
But then I went on to read and everywhere else through the book, Gordon Dixon refers to the

16:17.960 --> 16:24.820
patch as being on the sleeve. And this raises an interesting question. Is this our forgetful

16:24.820 --> 16:31.240
authors? No, no, it's just that the lady had two shirts. Two shirts. And that has happened, you know.

16:33.000 --> 16:38.060
It's perfectly understandable, but I was just struck by that right at the beginning.

16:38.060 --> 16:43.760
I'll tell the funnier one than that of myself. I did a novel called the Still Small Voice of

16:43.760 --> 16:51.060
Trumpets, in which I very carefully designed an alien trumpet. And I insisted when they were going

16:51.060 --> 16:57.240
to put the trumpeter on the jacket of the hardcover edition that I approved the drawing first. So

16:57.240 --> 17:05.560
we had these one arm trumpet players and he drew one of those for the jacket. So I very carefully

17:05.560 --> 17:10.740
went over the trumpet and made certain and exchanged letters with the artists and got that

17:10.740 --> 17:15.460
trumpet exactly the way that I wanted it and we were all pleased. And several years later,

17:15.480 --> 17:19.500
someone came to me and said, why is the trumpeter holding his trumpet in the wrong hand?

17:20.500 --> 17:25.760
And I had completely overlooked the fact that all these trumpeters were missing the left arm and

17:25.760 --> 17:32.320
the artist Jewett trumpeter holding the trumpet in his left arm. We've had other experiences like

17:32.320 --> 17:37.600
that have you not? I think all authors have had this kind of experience. It would be a little

17:37.600 --> 17:41.820
probably a slightly immediate subject to mind, but you have to, I think, quickly mention your

17:41.820 --> 17:50.820
career as a cellist. It's a funny story, really. Do you mind? Very quickly. Yes, well, I've been a

17:50.820 --> 17:58.080
clarinetist since I was nine years old and I got the advanced copy of the Dust Jacket on a new

17:58.080 --> 18:04.640
novel which had a little biography on it and this means that Doubleday already had printed

18:04.640 --> 18:09.840
up enough for the first edition of the book and they sent me a few. And the biography said,

18:11.300 --> 18:18.300
although he now is a full-time writer, he formerly was a musician and he still enjoys

18:18.300 --> 18:25.260
playing the cello and chamber music in his native state of Michigan. So I got a hold of my editor

18:25.260 --> 18:29.560
Doubleday and I said I've been a clarinetist since I was nine years old. Where did you get the idea

18:29.560 --> 18:34.260
that I played the cello? And she said, well, it's a beautiful instrument and if you start lessons

18:34.260 --> 18:40.240
right now, perhaps for the time the book is published, we'll be telling the truth. So I finally

18:40.240 --> 18:46.980
got things stopped so they would stop calling me a cellist, including catching the same error a

18:46.980 --> 18:52.140
couple of years later before it got in the print. And then I got the British edition of this same

18:52.140 --> 18:57.380
book and the British publisher based the copy on the American edition and now I am an internationally

18:57.380 --> 19:04.960
famous cellist. Well, we'll invite you to perform. That's going to come along. Back on the other

19:04.960 --> 19:13.340
subject there was, if I might put in one thing that helps really, is that when I went through and read

19:14.300 --> 19:23.760
another book I was illustrating, the author had two completely different descriptions in size

19:24.460 --> 19:31.460
of an alien in the front and the back. And I caught it where the editors hadn't caught it or anything

19:31.460 --> 19:36.900
because I was reading for illustrating, the editors were simply reading to correct.

19:40.720 --> 19:47.040
And in that particular case I was able to catch it, point it out and they changed one so that the

19:47.040 --> 19:53.760
two of them matched. This kind of thing is awfully easy to do in a 300 page book. It is indeed. Or for

19:53.760 --> 19:58.780
that matter in a television show, I had that experience in television too where one of my lines

19:58.780 --> 20:04.900
was knocked out of a, it was a Star Trek as a matter of fact, because they brought in another actor

20:04.900 --> 20:09.280
and they used a few more frames and they had to cut somewhere so they cut that.

20:09.980 --> 20:13.780
They had their noses so close to the production that they overlooked the fact that that particular

20:13.780 --> 20:19.680
line is the one that brought the entire plot into it. The only thing that made the entire plot mean

20:19.680 --> 20:24.940
anything so that without it the whole show would have been absolutely nothing. And it happened

20:24.940 --> 20:29.420
to be on the set at the time and able to correct it. But you are not always that lucky.

20:31.300 --> 20:42.640
No, it is very strange when you are reading a novel. I sit down with a pad and I will go through

20:43.460 --> 20:52.220
the manuscript and underscore descriptions of persons and write down. And I have not run across

20:52.220 --> 20:59.400
it yet but I am sure that someday I will find that he has black hair in the beginning and by

20:59.400 --> 21:08.740
that time it is very easy to lose sight of the broad range when you are right down close to it.

21:08.820 --> 21:13.520
Did you think that when these errors are made it is more often the fault of the author than the

21:13.520 --> 21:24.580
illustrator? No, it is quite often the illustrator does not even have a manuscript. He has got some

21:24.580 --> 21:32.200
art director that has told him the type of picture he wants and he draws. There was another very

21:32.200 --> 21:42.300
interesting one. This was for one of Gordy's books. I was sitting talking to him and he was very

21:42.300 --> 21:49.420
unhappy with the cover that they had done for it. Very, very unhappy. And I had read the story so

21:50.240 --> 21:54.360
I had a pad in front and I made a very quick sketch of maybe two or three minutes

21:55.440 --> 22:00.380
and said I had always thought this would be kind of a nice cover just a black and white sketch.

22:01.000 --> 22:06.360
And he said I love it. Can I have a copy of it? So I said here, sure, take the original.

22:07.100 --> 22:13.040
So he turned around without my knowledge, sent it off to the people that were putting the book

22:13.040 --> 22:17.440
and they liked it and wrote me back and asked if they could use it as the basis for a drawing.

22:17.440 --> 22:26.460
And I said sure, no problem. So they did. Well, it's about a sword and this sword plays a prominent

22:26.460 --> 22:34.720
part in the cover sketch which actually has two prongs coming out of a piece that covers the hand

22:34.720 --> 22:45.020
completely. It covers the hand. And I had simply made two quick lines. When it came out in the cover,

22:45.020 --> 22:52.740
the illustrator had made it a saber that is wide as the two lines of the prongs of the sword.

22:52.980 --> 22:58.300
He filled in between them and made it one. Because he had obviously not read the story,

22:58.580 --> 23:03.440
but here I had just two lines very quickly made and he closed them up.

23:04.220 --> 23:12.080
Gross errors are very disconcerting. But so many of them as you pointed out are the large errors

23:12.080 --> 23:18.040
that your heavy nose too close to it to be able to see. I've had a left-handed villain where the

23:18.040 --> 23:26.140
whole plot turned on his left-handedness drawing wielding a knife with his right hand. And six

23:26.140 --> 23:31.800
fingered people described throughout a novel are drawn with five fingers. Things like such as this.

23:32.520 --> 23:39.420
Well, again, I think this is because I think that the illustrators really don't see the manuscripts.

23:39.420 --> 23:48.600
They aren't even allowed to see them. The art director comes in and describes what he wants,

23:49.220 --> 23:55.560
and that's what he gets. Yeah, I think I wish it could be virtually a rigorous law or a convention

23:55.560 --> 24:01.160
that the artist read. Also, the people who write book jackets. Again, that's a little bit for the

24:01.160 --> 24:05.740
immediate subject. But I got it. It ought to be in writers' contracts that the people who write

24:05.740 --> 24:09.040
blurbs on book jackets will have read a copy of the book.

24:10.740 --> 24:14.060
Well, good. We can't blame either the illustrators or the authors,

24:14.620 --> 24:18.540
but the absent editors will have to take the blame right here.

24:18.560 --> 24:24.480
You know, you do have a point there. It really should be up to an editor to go over the whole

24:24.480 --> 24:29.820
thing, complete the illustrations and the book, and one final check to see that everything conforms.

24:29.940 --> 24:34.960
That really would solve the problem. You put your finger on it. I don't want to resolve myself,

24:34.960 --> 24:39.740
or I've pulled bubbles like that, and I have changing the color of the hair or something,

24:39.900 --> 24:45.620
but it's up to an editor to jump on those things, and they don't always.

24:46.140 --> 24:52.700
So occasionally, a very good copy editor will catch such mistakes, and you receive a query when

24:52.700 --> 24:57.400
you get the copy edited manuscript back saying his hair is brown on page 14.

24:58.900 --> 25:03.180
Funk and Wagnos, a company, was always meticulous about that,

25:03.180 --> 25:08.280
maybe because they were involved with dictionaries and so on. They're staffed by a bunch of lexicographers.

25:10.680 --> 25:25.880
There was that you that had, Lloyd, that had, where a copy editor caught an error in grammar

25:25.880 --> 25:32.540
in an alien language. I think that was Stanley Schmidt.

25:32.860 --> 25:38.360
Yes, that's right. We were talking to Stanley yesterday, and he had made up an alien language.

25:38.540 --> 25:45.620
And the copy editor caught an error in grammar, which they had deduced from reading the story.

25:46.020 --> 25:53.640
That copy editor was really on top of it. It seems like it's a very short step from illustrating

25:54.230 --> 26:04.640
science fiction writing to stage design, costume design for films and television shows.

26:05.120 --> 26:13.940
Have you gone that step, Jim? No, I haven't gone into that at all. I would like to get into it

26:13.940 --> 26:21.100
eventually, but as a full-time illustrator, I'm fairly new to the field. I've only been

26:21.100 --> 26:27.640
full-time illustrating one year. Is that right? I've been an artist for approximately 25 years

26:27.640 --> 26:34.160
professionally, but full-time illustrator only for the past year. And so I haven't gotten into that

26:34.160 --> 26:39.800
yet. I'm looking forward to it. The fans, however, if you go to a science fiction convention and see

26:39.800 --> 26:45.440
that costume ball, there's some of the costumes that are absolutely beautiful, absolutely beautiful,

26:45.440 --> 26:50.920
and taken from illustrations in science fiction magazines, as well of course as television

26:50.920 --> 26:57.760
in the movies. But some of them are absolutely breathtaking and very meticulously done from

26:57.760 --> 27:03.660
the stories and from the illustrations in magazines. Well, it's the fans that always pull us up short

27:03.660 --> 27:10.760
when we make mistakes. Oh, yes. It really is. They read much closer than I write.

27:12.480 --> 27:17.040
Gentlemen, it's been delightful talking with you. I want to thank you all very much for discussing

27:17.040 --> 27:25.160
this very important subject of art illustration and science fiction writing. Theodore Sturgeon

27:25.160 --> 27:32.220
and Lloyd Bigel are present authors and illustrator James R. Otbert. Thank you for joining me today.

27:32.660 --> 27:34.440
Thank you, Ed. Thank you very much. Thank you.
