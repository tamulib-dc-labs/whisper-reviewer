00:11.300 --> 00:18.420
The Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction today presented by the

00:18.420 --> 00:20.640
Permian Basin Science Fiction Association.

00:23.960 --> 00:27.120
This is David Cruz, Daryl Lane, and David Carson.

00:32.520 --> 00:34.660
The subject of this show is future histories.

00:35.600 --> 00:40.580
We need to define what we mean by future history because almost by definition any science fiction

00:40.580 --> 00:47.600
story deals with the future. And you know you could call it a future history simply because

00:47.600 --> 00:53.520
that's where it takes place, but as a descriptive term, as a particular concept, future history

00:53.520 --> 00:58.200
is something else. And I think there are certain criteria that have to be necessary for a future

00:58.200 --> 01:03.640
history story. And I think one of them would have to be a long time span. I think you have

01:03.640 --> 01:07.760
to have an author who's working over a period of centuries or even millennia for a true

01:07.760 --> 01:10.960
future history. You can't simply have two or three books that occur in a short period

01:10.960 --> 01:11.320
of time.

01:11.980 --> 01:16.540
Right. And one obvious thing would be that there would be more than one story concerning

01:16.540 --> 01:20.640
a certain background that an author has contrived.

01:21.120 --> 01:24.040
Well, it would have to be a series, more than one story obviously. There would have to be

01:24.040 --> 01:31.420
a series, some kind of progression or development or evolution to the stories. I don't think

01:31.420 --> 01:36.440
it's enough that you have a story or novels on one character. I think you have to have

01:37.480 --> 01:45.700
change over a long period of time and those changes have to be connected in an evolutionary

01:45.700 --> 01:47.160
way, in a progressive way.

01:48.120 --> 01:53.400
Yeah. So stories need to build toward a future which derives itself logically from the progressions

01:53.400 --> 01:53.920
in the stories.

01:54.280 --> 01:59.940
Right. Like if one story or one novel posits a new kind of technological innovation or

01:59.940 --> 02:00.500
a...

02:00.500 --> 02:02.680
Then that innovation will show up in following stories.

02:02.860 --> 02:06.560
Yeah. He would have to show the results of it sometime in the future, say a new space

02:06.560 --> 02:11.660
drive or a new social structure. He would have to follow that through with the implications

02:11.660 --> 02:13.140
of it, the results of it in the future.

02:13.620 --> 02:17.520
This tends to be something that is enjoyable for the reader as well because he can go back

02:17.520 --> 02:23.620
and relate to developments, inventions, or social orders that he knows about from previous

02:23.620 --> 02:29.900
stories and has a sense of involvement that way that is unique to future histories.

02:30.580 --> 02:36.540
I think there have been many authors who have attempted a future history, maybe not consciously,

02:36.760 --> 02:40.340
but any time an author I think writes more than one book with a certain character or

02:40.340 --> 02:43.780
follows through on a concept or idea. He's got the beginnings of a future history.

02:45.040 --> 02:50.420
Isaac Asimov I think in his foundation series had the makings of a future history. Of course

02:50.420 --> 02:54.500
that's a trilogy, the three books in the series, but he did follow through with concepts. It

02:54.500 --> 03:00.040
goes over hundreds of years in its time span. So that would have to qualify as a future

03:00.040 --> 03:02.480
series, but it's not as extensive I think as other authors.

03:03.340 --> 03:09.000
As true. Ursula K. Le Guin has done the same thing in her writing where she has communications

03:09.000 --> 03:13.900
equipment which is common in all the novels and her methods of space travel are common

03:14.520 --> 03:15.560
between all of her novels.

03:16.140 --> 03:19.900
I don't think she has many connections. She just mentions things, but if I recall she

03:19.900 --> 03:24.240
doesn't actually follow through with integral relationships between her books.

03:25.100 --> 03:26.340
Not specifically, no.

03:27.880 --> 03:32.440
And tonight I think we will be concentrating mostly on the works of three authors who seem

03:32.440 --> 03:42.980
to have created a series that are more comprehensive or longer, who have created series that are

03:42.980 --> 03:48.100
seemingly more comprehensive than some of the others perhaps. The authors are Robert

03:48.100 --> 03:53.820
Heinlein in his future history, the past through tomorrow, Paul Anderson's future history series,

03:53.940 --> 03:55.380
and also the works of Larry Niven.

04:06.380 --> 04:10.980
The original, the first, and probably one of the most influential of all writers who

04:10.980 --> 04:15.980
has done a future history, was not technically a science fiction author as such. He was a

04:15.980 --> 04:22.160
British philosopher named Olaf Stapledon. He died in 1950. His works are not really

04:22.160 --> 04:27.500
true novels or philosophical meditations on the future of man, but his influence has

04:27.500 --> 04:35.500
been tremendous. His best known work is entitled Last and First Men, published in 1930. And

04:35.500 --> 04:40.560
his future history takes in about two billion years from the present to about two billion

04:40.560 --> 04:46.940
years in the future. It covers the rise and fall of civilizations. It goes through evolutionary

04:46.940 --> 04:53.380
changes in man. I think he goes through 17 changes, the first men, second men, third men,

04:53.460 --> 05:00.900
and so forth. His last race of men are called the 18th men. And at the end of last and first

05:00.900 --> 05:06.600
men, they're at the edge of extinction. The human race is almost extinct. They're on

05:06.600 --> 05:10.740
Neptune. It's kind of interesting that in two billion years they've only gotten to Neptune.

05:11.380 --> 05:17.140
But at the end of that book, they're spraying artificial human spores into space with the

05:17.140 --> 05:21.360
hope that solar radiation will carry them to other parts of the galaxy. But he made

05:21.360 --> 05:28.220
charts, huge charts, and was mostly interested in his philosophy, where man was going, what

05:28.220 --> 05:34.080
man was like, defining the species as a whole and so forth. And his influence was very great

05:34.080 --> 05:35.620
on pure science fiction writers.

05:51.260 --> 05:56.100
In Robert Heinlein's future history, many of the activities take place on the Earth

05:56.100 --> 06:01.960
and then move out into our solar system. And not really beyond until much later in his

06:01.960 --> 06:06.740
series. One of his first books, our short stories, was The Roads Must Roll.

06:07.640 --> 06:14.020
This story presents us with a rather unique invention, I think, a new type of transportation

06:14.020 --> 06:21.100
system that's, as far as I know, not been used in other stories. It's a series of conveyor

06:21.100 --> 06:28.260
belts, if you will, extremely large, expansive conveyor belts that run at varying speeds right

06:28.260 --> 06:35.240
next to one another so that a person could step onto the first level at, say, five miles

06:35.240 --> 06:41.480
per hour and keep advancing to the next belt over until he's traveling 90 or 100 miles

06:41.480 --> 06:47.120
an hour. These things stretch over what we would consider our highway system now, to

06:47.120 --> 06:54.040
go all across the country and, I assume, the world. And the story is a commentary on the

06:55.400 --> 07:01.320
way the system works and the way it's become so expansive that it is no longer efficient

07:01.320 --> 07:07.420
and the way that the people are reacting to this fact. The strikers try to destroy the

07:07.420 --> 07:12.880
system and the men who are in charge of it, of course, try to protect it.

07:13.640 --> 07:16.740
Even though there's a strike and even though the roads aren't operating as efficiently

07:16.740 --> 07:21.460
as they should, I think it's a good example of extrapolation, science fiction extrapolation.

07:21.580 --> 07:26.640
This was written in the early 40s. And I think it's a pretty good guess by Heinlein, or pretty

07:26.640 --> 07:32.880
good look into the future, seeing the gasoline crisis, perhaps, seeing the proliferation

07:32.880 --> 07:37.160
of cars, the difficulty of transportation. Back in those days, it would seem to me fairly

07:37.160 --> 07:42.420
logical that someone could foresee mechanized roads. And in that sense, you know, thinking

07:42.420 --> 07:47.060
of the future, projecting or extrapolating what might come about, he was wrong. But on

07:47.060 --> 07:50.920
the other hand, back then, that was a pretty good guess, I would say.

07:52.220 --> 07:56.900
Another early story in his future history series, the earliest of all published in 1941,

07:57.140 --> 08:06.620
was called Lifeline. And it's sort of a gimmick story. An inventor named Pinaro, Dr. Pinaro,

08:06.700 --> 08:12.600
who turns up very briefly in some other works, has invented a machine that can tell exactly

08:12.600 --> 08:18.460
when a person will die. Of course, the insurance companies don't appreciate this. And after

08:18.460 --> 08:25.980
a long series of hassles and chases and arguments, they succeed in having him assassinated, which

08:25.980 --> 08:31.020
was no surprise to him because he predicted his own death down to the minute, too. But

08:31.020 --> 08:35.820
very soon, Heinlein got into the, I think he was encouraged by his editor in this future

08:35.820 --> 08:36.600
history series.

08:37.900 --> 08:44.100
John W. Campbell, Heinlein's editor, after printing a few of Heinlein's books, discovered

08:44.100 --> 08:50.480
his future history charts and published those, and encouraged Heinlein to fell out those charts

08:50.480 --> 08:55.940
with stories that Campbell would publish later on in astounding science fiction and other

08:55.940 --> 09:00.900
magazines. After Heinlein wrote the Rosemus Role, he wrote Blow-Ups Happen, which is concerned

09:00.900 --> 09:06.380
with atomic energy and its generation on the earth. His next series of books dealt with

09:06.380 --> 09:08.980
getting man to the moon and what man did on the moon.

09:10.160 --> 09:16.000
I think the majority of his future history dealt with moon exploration and the beginnings

09:16.000 --> 09:22.020
of exploration of the solar system. The man who sold the moon is one of his better known

09:22.020 --> 09:29.160
works, and I think one of the most fascinating of his novels. And basically, Heinlein thought

09:29.160 --> 09:34.080
that moon exploration or outer space exploration would be financed by private industry. Now,

09:34.080 --> 09:40.220
he was wrong there, but the book concerns the exploits of one man, a man named Harriman,

09:40.360 --> 09:45.760
D.D. Harriman. He has an obsession to go to the moon to explore the solar system. He

09:45.760 --> 09:50.880
happens to be a billionaire, of course, so he can indulge his obsession. And he does

09:50.880 --> 10:00.780
everything he can to sell the moon from having the spaceship built by his companies to publicizing

10:00.780 --> 10:06.920
it to advertising it, to getting the people worked up for it. There is some humor in the

10:06.920 --> 10:12.620
work, there's some satire, I remember for instance, in trying to get backing or advertising

10:12.620 --> 10:19.760
for the moon, money, get the people behind it. He talked to one soft drink company whose

10:20.340 --> 10:27.940
product was named Moch into projecting, or at least he thought they could, project the

10:27.940 --> 10:32.780
symbol of their product on the moon from the earth. In other words, people would look at

10:32.780 --> 10:36.560
the moon and see the symbol of a soft drink. And in doing this, of course, he was trying

10:36.560 --> 10:43.100
to sell the moon to get the people behind it. The end of the work, he succeeded through

10:43.100 --> 10:50.520
all sorts of chicanery, through exploitation, through pushing, through the force of his

10:50.520 --> 10:54.860
personality. He's got people on the moon, and he's been successful, although he himself

10:54.860 --> 10:59.160
can never go, because by this time he's an old man. Or at least at this point in time,

10:59.400 --> 11:02.920
Heine led you to believe that he won't ever go. He did try later, I think, didn't he?

11:03.100 --> 11:10.220
In a book, or excuse me, a short story called Requiem, Herrerman finally does reach the

11:10.220 --> 11:16.520
moon, and he dies while he's embarking from the spaceship on the moon, and he finally

11:16.520 --> 11:20.280
reaches the moon's surface, but he dies there. And we get the idea that he knew he was going

11:20.280 --> 11:24.320
to die, but to him it was worth it. In fact, he had to, as rich as he was, as famous as

11:24.320 --> 11:29.060
he was, he had to do it secretly. He had to bribe two pilots to take him, he had to get

11:29.060 --> 11:33.020
the spaceship set up secretly. And I'm sure he knew it was going to be his last flight,

11:33.080 --> 11:35.280
but this is what he wanted, and he succeeded.

11:36.160 --> 11:39.700
In a collection of short stories called The Green Hills of Earth, Highland explores many

11:39.700 --> 11:42.440
aspects of the colonization of our solar system.

11:43.960 --> 11:48.640
He does that in many ways. He covers questions such as women's liberation with Delilah in

11:48.640 --> 11:54.020
the Space Rigor, the first woman to work on a space station. Of course, she has trouble

11:54.020 --> 11:55.540
at first, but the men finally accept her.

11:56.500 --> 12:01.420
Another story, the title story, The Green Hills of Earth, concerned a blind bard or a singer

12:01.420 --> 12:07.660
poet of the spaceways, who's, he is blind, the men take him on their ship simply because

12:07.660 --> 12:12.120
he used to be a spaceman, and has saved, in fact, saved a whole ship full of people. But

12:12.120 --> 12:15.860
now he's a poet, a singer, even though he's blind. And it's more of a human interest story,

12:15.940 --> 12:19.560
which Highland does emphasize a great deal in his future history.

12:21.020 --> 12:26.440
The point at which he left colonization of the solar system and exploration of the moon,

12:26.500 --> 12:30.340
I think, was in one of his better known novels entitled Methuselah's Children.

12:31.920 --> 12:39.160
The way he did it is interesting. There was a family or a group of people who, through

12:39.160 --> 12:44.800
mutation alone, became almost immortal. Their lifespans were at least three or four times

12:44.800 --> 12:49.900
out of normal humans, and some of them even longer. And one of his family was entitled,

12:50.200 --> 12:54.060
his name was Lazarus Long, who turns up in a lot of Highland stories, one of his more

12:54.060 --> 13:00.960
famous characters. But Highland does this very well in showing the, the reaction of,

13:01.260 --> 13:05.340
the family has to hide their secret, the fact that they're almost immortal. But the reaction

13:05.340 --> 13:10.840
of society is sharp when they find out the existence of these people. They think that

13:10.840 --> 13:16.220
the family is keeping a secret of longevity from them, which they're not. So the family's

13:16.220 --> 13:23.640
in great danger. And they finally commandeer or hijack an experimental interstellar craft.

13:24.060 --> 13:28.600
It's going to be the first one to leave the solar system. They hijack it. They take off

13:28.600 --> 13:33.520
for the stars. And after many adventures and meeting a couple of alien races, they do come

13:33.520 --> 13:38.080
back to Earth. And in the meantime, the rest of humanity, because of the time difference,

13:38.080 --> 13:42.840
has discovered ways of increasing their own life spans. So the time, the problem there's

13:42.840 --> 13:48.400
been taken care of. Highland did continue with this and is one of his last works, 1973,

13:48.880 --> 13:54.800
the time enough for love. He has a character of Lazarus Long again in that work, but it's

13:54.800 --> 13:58.720
very loosely connected to the rest of his story. Just the connection is not very sharp.

14:11.780 --> 14:17.520
Paul Anderson's future history is quite a bit more expansive than Highland's. Highland's

14:18.100 --> 14:23.820
covered about 625 years. Anderson's covers a few thousand years. He starts in the 21st

14:23.820 --> 14:30.460
century. And after the human beings have discovered a way of traveling faster than light, they

14:30.460 --> 14:36.900
have an interstellar drive. And human society breaks up into many, many different colonies

14:36.900 --> 14:40.260
throughout the galaxy, different planets, different areas with very little communication

14:40.260 --> 14:46.560
between them. Sort of a far flung breakup is what it's called. And this portion of his

14:46.560 --> 14:52.080
future history is called the Polysotectic League. And probably the dominating character

14:52.080 --> 14:55.560
of that, the stories involving the league is Nicholas Van Rijn.

14:57.000 --> 15:03.560
One of the main elements that Paul Anderson has foreseen here is that the Polysotectic

15:03.560 --> 15:07.460
League and all of humanity as it stretches out through the stars would be a trading

15:07.460 --> 15:10.020
empire, more like a frontier.

15:10.880 --> 15:16.600
Vegley Rumanison of the East India Company and whatnot that went on around the 17th and

15:16.600 --> 15:17.240
18th century.

15:18.480 --> 15:33.540
Right. And he introduces characters who are taking advantage of this aspect, principally

15:33.540 --> 15:38.220
the novel of the Polysotectic League or his future history series called Tragedor to the

15:38.220 --> 15:38.480
Stars.

15:39.380 --> 15:44.280
In the first story of Tragedor to the Stars, hiding place, we're introduced to Nicholas,

15:44.520 --> 15:50.580
who is on board of a yacht. And he and his crew are trying to escape from some human enemies.

15:51.140 --> 15:55.760
The yacht is defective and they know that they can't get away from these humans. So

15:55.760 --> 16:00.220
they drop out of their hyperdrive, which is shuttling them along higher than the speed

16:00.220 --> 16:06.060
of light into normal space and search for an alien ship, which they believe they might

16:06.060 --> 16:10.360
be lucky enough to find circling a particular star. They don't know anything about these

16:10.360 --> 16:15.580
aliens and all they want is just a ship that they can get a hold of to go on to their base.

16:16.320 --> 16:21.120
When they do drop out of light speed, they find a ship and they try to board it. When

16:21.120 --> 16:27.660
they get there and force their way on board, the aliens have disappeared and they've taken

16:27.660 --> 16:32.380
everything out of their control room that might indicate what size or shape they are.

16:32.960 --> 16:37.120
When they look into the hold of the ship, they find what is essentially an interstellar

16:37.120 --> 16:42.620
zoo. It's apparently a ship that the aliens have been using to transport alien creatures

16:43.130 --> 16:50.760
to different places in their solar system. And they have apparently taken one of the

16:50.760 --> 16:56.020
empty cages themselves and have hidden there so that the humans don't know which ones

16:56.020 --> 17:03.080
they are. The entire thing centers around Nicholas trying to outsmart the aliens and

17:03.080 --> 17:06.820
find out who they are in time for them to get the ship working and get out of there

17:06.820 --> 17:12.640
before the human enemies catch up with them. It's a typical Van Rijn story because everyone

17:12.640 --> 17:17.920
else by the end of the story has given up hope of ever getting away. And only Nicholas

17:17.920 --> 17:21.680
is calm enough and cool enough in his own mind to make it work.

17:21.680 --> 17:25.980
And clever enough too, I think a man like Nicholas has to, well he operates on his wits.

17:26.060 --> 17:32.820
He's not the heroic type. He does things because of his quick-wittedness, his cleverness. And

17:32.820 --> 17:39.660
I think there's a certain logic to his motivation too. When you think of it, the trading empire,

17:40.360 --> 17:46.720
the profit motive that Nicholas Van Rijn is involved with, with such a huge number of

17:46.720 --> 17:52.180
colonies with worlds scattered over the entire galaxy, it's not practical for any one world

17:52.180 --> 17:56.820
to try to dominate to a form of government. This polysotectonic league was really not

17:56.820 --> 17:58.960
a government, it was more of a trading empire.

17:59.500 --> 18:04.380
Another similar story to this is the War of the Wingmen, which was reissued I think

18:04.380 --> 18:10.340
under the name the man who counts. Again, it's a Nicholas Van Rijn story. He changes

18:10.340 --> 18:16.700
all the rules because in the end he's the one that gets the rewards, the girl, and arranges

18:16.720 --> 18:20.640
the escape from their marooned situation on this alien planet.

18:22.400 --> 18:27.960
The planet itself gives Anderson an excuse to exercise his talents at world building.

18:28.940 --> 18:37.240
The planet is set 90 degrees off center on its axis, thus giving extreme changes in seasons

18:37.240 --> 18:42.220
from year to year. The planet is twice the diameter of the earth and five times its mass,

18:42.220 --> 18:47.360
but the densest material it's made up of is calcium and lighter materials, thus giving

18:47.360 --> 18:53.860
it a gravity only slightly greater than the earth. The atmosphere is much deeper and thicker

18:53.860 --> 18:57.700
than on the earth and is able to support a humanoid flying mammal.

18:59.000 --> 19:03.720
These creatures are the intelligent life of the planet and are the focus of the manipulations

19:03.720 --> 19:10.180
of Nicholas Van Rijn. His sole object is to get himself and his party off the planet

19:10.180 --> 19:14.680
in one piece and he really doesn't care how far he has to go lying, stealing, cheating,

19:14.820 --> 19:21.580
whatever to get that end accomplished. He manages to go through quite a few different manipulations

19:21.580 --> 19:30.860
in this process, but showing his characteristic crabbiness and his characteristic cleverness

19:30.860 --> 19:33.740
at the same time, he manages to make this come off.

19:34.180 --> 19:38.660
As you pointed out earlier at the end of the book, the whole space opera motif has been

19:38.660 --> 19:43.700
changed and Nicholas Van Rijn, who is very unheroic, has succeeded in saving his companions,

19:43.900 --> 19:50.320
one of whom is a beautiful woman, and really performing actions which you would only expect

19:50.880 --> 19:55.480
a great hero to be able to perform, but Van Rijn does it simply with his cleverness,

19:55.720 --> 20:00.480
his apparent selfishness, but really his actions seem to benefit everybody.

20:01.580 --> 20:06.380
The net effect is one of both humor and great enjoyment.

20:07.900 --> 20:13.220
There was one other major division in Anderson's future history. The polysotectonic league

20:13.220 --> 20:21.600
lasted for millennia, but it did fall finally. After a period called the Time of Troubles,

20:22.040 --> 20:32.320
the Terran Empire took over most of the galaxy. Probably his character as well known as Nicholas

20:32.320 --> 20:36.140
Van Rijn takes up most of these stories, Dominic Flandry.

20:37.860 --> 20:42.640
With Flandry, Anderson has the opportunity to grow up with a character. We see him first

20:42.640 --> 20:47.720
of all when he's a young, innocent space cadet just entering the service of the Terran Empire.

20:48.760 --> 20:54.940
We see him grow, we see him become an agent, a diplomat, a very important force in this

20:54.940 --> 21:02.300
Terran Empire. He is different than Van Rijn. He's sophisticated, he's smooth, he's a

21:02.320 --> 21:07.260
good guy. He does operate by his wits, but he's more of a hero type in that he can fight,

21:08.840 --> 21:17.280
he can perform heroic actions. But he does it with sort of a James Bond-ish cynicism

21:17.280 --> 21:20.580
or a James Bond-ish kind of flair, panache about him.

21:21.540 --> 21:25.440
But I think there are a number of novels and stories about Dominic Flandry following his

21:25.440 --> 21:32.240
whole lifespan until almost the fall of the Terran Empire, which would end Anderson's

21:32.840 --> 21:36.660
future history series. There's one story, I believe, which goes beyond the Terran Empire,

21:38.860 --> 21:44.180
which suggests that things are coming back together after its fall. But the Terrans or

21:44.180 --> 21:49.000
the Earthlings did have one major enemy, the Merseans, in this section of Anderson's future

21:49.000 --> 21:53.700
history. And Flandry's job for most of the stories and novels built around him was to

21:53.700 --> 21:55.560
combat the Mersean threat.

22:06.900 --> 22:10.920
The third author we're considering under the future history framework is Larry Niven.

22:11.960 --> 22:15.880
Niven is probably one of the most popular of the present day science fiction writers.

22:16.040 --> 22:22.180
He's young, he's bright, he loves to write, very personable, and he's constructed a tightly

22:22.180 --> 22:26.360
connected future history series and attracted a great many fans in doing so.

22:26.360 --> 22:34.580
Well, many of these fans are quite involved in the works themselves. They've worked out

22:34.580 --> 22:40.700
elaborate charts and timelines and have written Niven and given him all sorts of feedback

22:40.700 --> 22:47.980
on the works that he's written. In fact, this has become rather complex and can be a problem,

22:48.060 --> 22:52.640
I guess, to some future history writers in that you better have everything just right

22:52.640 --> 22:57.980
or some preacher's going to pick out an error and show it to you. Some of the errors that,

22:58.060 --> 23:04.040
for instance, that were involved in the novel Ringworld that was so popular about ten years

23:04.040 --> 23:11.780
ago were mentioned to him by fans and he worked them out in the sequel and explained them

23:11.780 --> 23:15.540
away, which must have been quite a challenge for him to do.

23:16.280 --> 23:20.260
In fact, if I recall, he had said in one of his volumes that he wasn't going to write

23:20.260 --> 23:25.020
any more in his future history. I forget which volume he said that in, but later he

23:25.020 --> 23:29.020
did write Ringworld Engineers and I suspect it was because of his fans, the pressure on

23:29.020 --> 23:31.580
him to continue with the timeline that he'd started.

23:31.960 --> 23:36.040
Yes, he said that he had no intention of completing that story but went on ahead because of the

23:36.040 --> 23:38.340
reaction to the story, so popular.

23:40.060 --> 23:44.660
Niven's future history starts off on our present and works its way forward to the year 3100,

23:45.400 --> 23:52.620
starting off with the beginnings of an organ bank where people, in the beginning, when

23:53.160 --> 23:57.100
they die, leave organs to be implanted in other people and that later grows into a system

23:57.100 --> 24:04.240
where people many times unwillingly end up donating organs to this organ bank and it

24:04.240 --> 24:07.540
also has the first manned explorations of our solar system.

24:08.200 --> 24:13.740
He also brings in the dolphins and the whales, I believe, as an intelligent race and gives

24:13.740 --> 24:22.740
equal rights to those creatures. The organ bank thing becomes rather more expansive within

24:22.740 --> 24:28.940
the next hundred years or so as everyone wants to live as long as they can. They begin to

24:28.940 --> 24:35.360
pass laws saying any minor infractions that you might commit automatically entail the

24:35.360 --> 24:39.280
death penalty so that your body parts can be used for other people.

24:39.280 --> 24:46.960
Early colonization of our surrounding star systems was done by a ship called Abusard

24:46.960 --> 24:53.160
Ramjet, which because of its extremely intense magnetic field, no human occupant could travel

24:53.160 --> 24:58.240
in the ship, therefore they were sent out as sort of robot probes. Later on they developed

24:58.240 --> 25:02.100
a system which by they could shield the ship and human occupants could go along with them.

25:02.100 --> 25:10.740
But he made some very interesting stories surrounding these early colonization ships

25:10.740 --> 25:16.740
where the robot-controlled Abusard Ramjet would go out and scout out a planet and land

25:16.740 --> 25:21.660
on it and say this planet is suitable for human habitation and then would radio the

25:22.420 --> 25:27.700
slow boats which were following it at sublight speed to come to this location and this would

25:27.700 --> 25:31.920
make a good place for a settlement. All the colonists on board the slow boats were

25:31.920 --> 25:36.040
sent suspended animation and did not know exactly where they were heading. They depended

25:36.040 --> 25:42.200
upon the accuracy of the robot probe which made for some very interesting planets which

25:42.200 --> 25:47.860
ended up being colonized by humankind. One of them was called Mount Look at That and

25:47.860 --> 25:54.200
it got its name by the ram robot came down and landed in a particular area. It tested

25:54.200 --> 25:58.020
all the gases and everything and found out this place was perfectly habitable for human

25:58.020 --> 26:04.880
beings and radioed the slow boat and they followed it to its location and then the computer

26:04.880 --> 26:09.680
aboard the slow boat woke up the crew and they went down to land on the surface of the

26:09.680 --> 26:15.620
planet and they were aghast to find out that the surface was made of pure methane, totally

26:15.620 --> 26:20.600
uninhabitable and they were flying along the rim of the atmosphere and finally they

26:20.600 --> 26:26.280
see this plateau reaching 40 miles straight up from the surface of the planet being about

26:26.280 --> 26:30.480
the size of California and when the pilot sees it he goes, well dang, look at that.

26:31.020 --> 26:32.120
There go the name of the planet.

26:34.400 --> 26:39.820
I think one of his novels dealt with the society on that planet, the gift from earth I believe.

26:40.860 --> 26:49.520
True that was a gift from earth is the end of the organ banks per se because the end

26:49.520 --> 26:55.460
developments in a gift from earth they learned to clone various organs where if somebody

26:55.460 --> 26:57.900
needed to deliver they would simply clone and grow a liver.

26:59.180 --> 27:04.360
In introducing the novel Ringworld, one of his most popular books, we need to go back

27:04.360 --> 27:10.180
to about the year 2500 when humanity meets another alien race known as the Pearson's

27:10.180 --> 27:17.700
puppeteers. This is a very strange race who are very technical and very advanced but seemingly

27:18.260 --> 27:23.220
socially different from us in that they are extremely cowardly. All of their activities

27:23.220 --> 27:28.900
are regulated by this cowardice. They want to protect themselves to the point where they

27:28.900 --> 27:34.940
do anything including build a high technological society to do so. This novel won both Hugo

27:34.940 --> 27:36.520
and Nebula awards for Larry Niven.

27:37.300 --> 27:44.780
The Ringworld is an extrapolation on a Diason sphere which is a, if you can imagine a hollow

27:45.540 --> 27:51.680
sphere built around a sun and then set spinning so that you can have gravity on the inside.

27:52.600 --> 27:58.440
The Ringworld is simply a ring built around a sun with mountains on the edge of the ring

27:58.440 --> 28:03.260
at least a thousand miles high in order to keep the atmosphere inside it. Set the ring

28:03.260 --> 28:09.060
rotating in order to create gravity on the inside and there you've got a habitat with

28:09.060 --> 28:12.300
approximately three trillion times the surface area of the earth.

28:25.480 --> 28:29.320
I think there would be a major theme to all three of these authors that we've covered on

28:29.320 --> 28:33.660
the show and their future history concept. First of all any author who constructs a

28:33.660 --> 28:38.900
future history I think is optimistic about man's future. You know man has a future therefore

28:38.900 --> 28:45.880
he's going to write about it. And I see in all of them the expansion of man, the idea

28:45.880 --> 28:51.080
that man is going to be unstoppable. He will progress. He may fall many times but he will

28:51.080 --> 28:57.600
still keep going. So overall I would say that each author treats the rise and fall of human

28:57.600 --> 29:02.080
civilization in the future. You know the high points and the low points but man still keeps

29:02.080 --> 29:05.940
going. I think that's very strong in Heinlein and also in Anderson and Niven.

29:13.140 --> 29:19.840
This is David Cruz, Daryl Lane and David Carson. This has been the Science Fiction Radio

29:19.840 --> 29:26.780
