00:08.980 --> 00:13.080
Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

00:29.280 --> 00:34.760
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and fantasy.

00:37.760 --> 00:39.240
And here are your hosts.

00:44.740 --> 00:45.860
This is Daryl Lane.

00:46.080 --> 00:46.860
And David Cruz.

00:47.440 --> 00:51.400
Some of the most exciting science fiction being written today comes from the Pan of Jack Chalker.

00:51.900 --> 00:57.160
And it's clear that he's a popular writer too, probably best known for the five books in the Well World series.

00:57.660 --> 01:02.260
In fact, the first novel in that series, Midnight at the Well of Souls, has sold over a million copies.

01:02.900 --> 01:08.400
Chalker's first book came out not that long ago, 1976, so his work is still fairly recent.

01:08.700 --> 01:21.820
He'd been active in the field, though, years before he started writing, corresponding with authors and other fans, attending conventions, editing a fanzine, even starting a small publishing company, Mirage Press, to produce material on science fiction.

01:22.400 --> 01:24.800
But Chalker says he'd always planned on being a writer.

01:26.220 --> 01:28.260
I'd always known I was going to be a writer.

01:28.700 --> 01:30.760
I mean, there just was never any question in my mind.

01:31.380 --> 01:34.440
But it was just sort of something that you never really sat down and did.

01:34.560 --> 01:36.920
I used to play around with stories here and there.

01:38.260 --> 01:39.860
John Campbell was a big help.

01:41.960 --> 01:49.680
During the 60s, I would float ideas and fragments off him, and he would be very, very nice and tell me exactly what was wrong.

01:49.680 --> 02:01.440
Of course, what had created everybody about John Campbell was that the man had been editing for 40 years, and he could put his finger on something and tell you exactly what you were doing wrong.

02:02.000 --> 02:06.220
And it was terribly infuriating to discover that he was right in almost every case.

02:07.440 --> 02:10.720
He saw why he did it from 39 until he died.

02:12.540 --> 02:30.400
And as a result of being able to have the help of people like Campbell and August Arilith and a lot of really established writers and editors in the field, I was able to get a good recognition of exactly what was required in the field.

02:31.500 --> 02:34.220
It just was a matter of sitting down and doing it.

02:35.300 --> 02:39.940
And fortunately, he did sit down and do it, publishing Jungle of Stars in 1976.

02:41.580 --> 02:50.120
So I sat on a typewriter, and there was really no question in my mind as to what I'd do first.

02:51.900 --> 02:55.780
I had been playing around with an idea for years and years and years.

02:56.660 --> 03:04.200
There's even a short, fancy version of it, 20 years old, called Jungle or Jungle of Stars.

03:05.320 --> 03:08.400
There were a lot of codewords, but Jungle was always in it.

03:09.620 --> 03:13.340
And I sat down and wrote the things.

03:13.860 --> 03:25.280
I'd been around so long in my mind and in discussions and so on that there were just no problems, no resistance, no having to think it out or anything else.

03:26.300 --> 03:29.420
And I wrote it solidly in about two and a half, three weeks.

03:31.200 --> 03:32.900
And then sent it off.

03:34.400 --> 03:38.320
And it's a good old-fashioned type.

03:39.240 --> 03:42.360
It's a science fiction murder mystery.

03:43.900 --> 03:49.120
Very much at home in the old, astounding analogs and so on.

03:49.120 --> 03:51.960
Even though I thought that's a modern touch to it.

03:57.780 --> 04:01.780
Some of his earlier contacts with people in the field of science fiction paid off.

04:02.040 --> 04:04.300
One of them, Judy Lindell Ray, bought the novel.

04:05.760 --> 04:19.840
Judy Lindell Ray, who had just become editor of Ballantine, which was soon to have a science fiction line named after her, took a look at it.

04:19.840 --> 04:22.380
We'd known each other for about 15 years.

04:23.740 --> 04:33.180
And she put off reading it for quite a long time because she was afraid that if it was terrible and she said so, that she'd blow our friendship or something.

04:33.900 --> 04:39.920
Finally, she said, we got together at a convention and she admitted to me all this.

04:40.120 --> 04:41.860
She said, okay, I'll read it, but be prepared.

04:42.540 --> 04:47.440
And about four days later, I get a phone call and she said, hey, this is great. I want to buy it.

04:48.820 --> 04:50.400
And that was the first sale.

04:52.080 --> 04:55.960
Since then, Chalker has published some 13 novels and he's still going strong.

04:56.660 --> 04:58.260
More with Jack Chalker next time.

05:05.560 --> 05:14.220
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show, a production of the Permian Basin Science Fiction Association, produced in conjunction with Odessa College in Odessa, Texas.

05:17.440 --> 05:47.420
The first time I read it, I was so surprised.

05:58.460 --> 06:02.420
Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

06:18.460 --> 06:23.680
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and fantasy.

06:26.480 --> 06:28.060
And here are your hosts.

06:33.080 --> 06:34.420
This is David Cruz.

06:34.680 --> 06:35.360
And Darrell Lane.

06:35.900 --> 06:42.620
A hike through a national park and a war game board, unlikely sources for a tremendously popular science fiction novel.

06:43.020 --> 06:46.540
The novel is Midnight at the Well of Souls. The author is Jack Chalker.

06:46.540 --> 06:51.660
The book concerns the Well World, an artificial planet constructed by a vanished civilization.

06:52.280 --> 07:00.840
The Well World is divided into 1560 separate environments, separate worlds really, each with its own climate, geography and intelligent inhabitants.

07:01.440 --> 07:05.260
Each division is shaped like a hexagon and for that reason they're called hexes.

07:05.920 --> 07:12.900
Chalker was in an isolated village called Stahikin on the shore of Lake Chelan in Central Washington State when he got the idea for the Well World.

07:14.400 --> 07:18.700
I got sitting by the lake that night and talking with some people.

07:19.740 --> 07:29.700
And I got the idea for this large world built by a long dead race and so on.

07:29.820 --> 07:32.280
And I didn't really have much of an idea of what it was.

07:33.080 --> 07:38.140
And they do have a service out of Stahikin that'll take you up to Trailhead.

07:39.180 --> 07:42.740
And so I went up to Trailhead and I wound up walking down.

07:42.980 --> 07:46.060
I'm a great hiker as long as the direction is down.

07:47.960 --> 07:52.620
I'm afraid I've never been to the bottom of the Grand Canyon because I can get down there but I can't get back up.

07:53.480 --> 07:59.860
But here was a trail that Taylor made for me. It was down the Cascades, all the way.

08:01.020 --> 08:08.400
So I took it and it took about eight and a half hours to walk the whole distance.

08:11.060 --> 08:13.900
And during that time you go through eight climates.

08:14.460 --> 08:18.120
You start off in the snow, you wind up in a rainforest.

08:19.660 --> 08:22.140
And some of the changes are rather abrupt.

08:22.360 --> 08:27.320
You just go around a switchback and it just changes from one climate to another.

08:27.320 --> 08:32.780
Each with its own different plants and insects and occasional mammals.

08:33.520 --> 08:35.320
Even the birds seem to be different.

08:35.580 --> 08:38.080
And I thought, yeah, this is how that big world would be like.

08:39.300 --> 08:43.680
So even though while I was on my way down I was kind of scribbling ideas.

08:45.800 --> 08:56.320
And I got the idea for this giant world composed of basically world-like different abrupt geography, climate, landforms.

08:56.320 --> 08:59.560
You name it, each with its own dominant race.

09:02.380 --> 09:09.360
By the time I hit bottom my head had pretty well worked out although I didn't really know what the shape of the things were going to be.

09:10.720 --> 09:14.060
Back home in Maryland he got some help on the shape of the well world.

09:15.380 --> 09:20.840
I was discussing the idea with a science fiction fan named Ben Yellow, some of that.

09:20.840 --> 09:21.480
No bellwitter.

09:22.900 --> 09:23.540
Rosalina.

09:24.300 --> 09:27.840
And he says, why don't you just use an Avalon Hill game board?

09:29.620 --> 09:31.220
And I thought, yeah, that would work.

09:31.820 --> 09:38.940
So we got out an Avalon Hill map, a war game map and a little trusty calculator.

09:39.760 --> 09:45.600
We laid a grid of these hexagons around a roughly earth-sized world.

09:46.260 --> 09:48.760
Of course you cannot cover a sphere with hexagons.

09:49.180 --> 09:55.680
So that means we had the north zone and the south zone, which would be the embassy's entry and exit point.

09:56.900 --> 09:58.320
That would cover our sphere.

09:59.380 --> 10:05.060
And then it was just simply a matter of sitting down and listing what was required to do.

10:05.960 --> 10:12.620
What kind of creatures and land, climate and so on I would have to do for the route of the story.

10:13.660 --> 10:21.980
Dropping by Avalon Hill, which I lived very near at the time, picking up some blank maps and just working it out from there.

10:23.440 --> 10:27.940
What Chalker worked out turned into his best known novel, Midnight at the Well of Souls.

10:28.540 --> 10:32.400
It was so popular that it went out of print a few months after its initial press run.

10:32.720 --> 10:36.820
And Chalker has added four novels since then, making a five book series in the well world.

10:36.820 --> 10:42.960
The whole thing turned out to be a colorful and exciting epic on the origin of the universe and all of the creatures in it.

10:43.380 --> 10:45.680
It should fascinate any reader of science fiction.

10:46.200 --> 10:47.720
More on Jack Chalker next time.

10:55.400 --> 11:00.760
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show, a production of the Permian Basin Science Fiction Association

11:00.760 --> 11:04.060
produced in conjunction with Odessa College in Odessa, Texas.

11:06.820 --> 11:36.800
The first episode of the show was made in the late 19th century by the late 19th century.

11:50.480 --> 11:54.420
Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

12:10.440 --> 12:15.640
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and fantasy.

12:18.440 --> 12:20.020
And here are your hosts.

12:24.820 --> 12:26.100
This is Daryl Lane.

12:26.420 --> 12:27.140
And David Cruz.

12:27.600 --> 12:32.080
The five novels in Jack Chalker's Well World series are based on a familiar science fiction concept.

12:32.080 --> 12:38.180
And that concept is the notion of a long dead race of superior beings whose artifacts are found by humans.

12:38.520 --> 12:42.520
But there are a couple of interesting twists given to this concept by Chalker.

12:43.220 --> 12:45.960
One twist is the principal artifact by the vanished race.

12:46.420 --> 12:48.340
It's a planet called the Well World.

12:48.860 --> 12:54.720
It's artificial and its interior is a super computer that can transform matter into all sorts of living creatures.

12:54.720 --> 13:01.920
It's really a laboratory planet where species are created and tested before being transferred to various places throughout the universe.

13:02.360 --> 13:07.480
And the other twist is that the superior beings, called the Markovians, aren't actually gone.

13:08.160 --> 13:10.860
They just transformed themselves into other, more primitive beings.

13:11.500 --> 13:13.280
Chalker talks about the Markovians.

13:14.040 --> 13:23.380
They got to the point where they were gone, literally, where their devices could conjure up anything they wanted, just with a mere thought of it.

13:25.120 --> 13:34.860
I sense that it pointed out to me that they're sort of like the Crel in the old movie Forbidden Planet, and that they reached this Godhead status.

13:35.580 --> 13:41.200
But the Crel experiments failed because they couldn't control their passions.

13:42.160 --> 13:47.420
And the Markovian experiments succeeded and they literally became gods and they became miserable.

13:47.420 --> 13:51.820
There was nothing left to attain. There was nothing left to know.

13:53.000 --> 14:01.540
You had a bunch of creatures that spent millions of years rising to this point and they sit around and they say, is this all there is?

14:03.100 --> 14:05.980
At this point, the Markovians decided to start all over again.

14:06.800 --> 14:25.500
The idea of the great experiment came about was to redo it, to literally start the Markovians over from scratch with different kinds of creatures, different environments, with no real value system.

14:25.780 --> 14:29.360
I mean, they have to develop their own unique value systems. They do.

14:30.260 --> 14:36.820
And as a result, they're grown and they're tested on this laboratory world, the well world.

14:37.280 --> 14:48.320
And then they were the ones that worked, the ones that showed promise of survival, were then set into motion out throughout the universe, including man.

14:50.940 --> 15:03.560
And they had the hope that eventually one of these races would reach a state of perfection that would not be empty or hollow.

15:04.600 --> 15:10.620
Now, I personally believe that when you reach that state, it is empty and hollow.

15:11.360 --> 15:19.880
But that's just my feeling other people might certainly do think differently.

15:21.900 --> 15:26.800
The Markovians create hundreds of different species, all intelligent, but all incredibly different.

15:27.240 --> 15:30.780
We asked Tucker how he gets ideas for creating such a variety of aliens.

15:32.320 --> 15:44.040
I used a variety of things. In some cases, a good pictorial natural history text will give you more weird creatures than you've ever seen, which can be modified.

15:45.820 --> 15:54.320
Some came out of mythology. Some came more or less direct out of Fantasia, sorts of like that.

15:55.020 --> 15:59.580
And a few came out of comic book concepts.

16:01.020 --> 16:06.340
You just draw them in from all over and you use basic shapes and basic types.

16:07.260 --> 16:14.700
And then you adjust them to what would happen if these were real, convenient, intelligent creatures.

16:16.300 --> 16:23.120
I found very, very little trouble in coming up with an enormous variety of them.

16:23.780 --> 16:29.480
I'm not sure whether I could come up with 1,560, which is the number I would have to to visit every hex in the world.

16:30.360 --> 16:33.240
But I've had no trouble coming up with the 2,300 so far.

16:34.160 --> 16:35.880
More with Jack Chalker next time.

16:43.520 --> 16:52.180
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show, a production of the Permian Basin Science Fiction Association, produced in conjunction with Odessa College in Odessa, Texas.

17:05.880 --> 17:35.860
The show is about the science fiction genre.

17:45.500 --> 17:49.440
Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

18:05.860 --> 18:10.660
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and fantasy.

18:13.540 --> 18:15.020
And here are your hosts.

18:19.920 --> 18:21.080
This is Daryl Lane.

18:21.400 --> 18:22.100
And David Cruz.

18:22.560 --> 18:29.600
Before you became a best-selling science fiction author, Jack Chalker was an avid fan who built an amateur fanzine into a science fiction publishing company.

18:29.600 --> 18:37.560
Chalker started the fanzine in his early teens as a way of making contacts in the field of science fiction and with the possibility of making a little money at it.

18:38.940 --> 18:48.200
That basically was the reason we started with the fanzine, which was run off actually at a school, the beginning, because we didn't have anything else.

18:50.780 --> 18:55.900
And he'd got some reasonably good reactions, so I started building up from there.

18:56.360 --> 19:06.460
While I was doing that, actually, I had correspondence already with enormous numbers of people, both professional and fan.

19:07.380 --> 19:14.120
I had so much correspondence, I can't believe how many people I was contacting on a regular basis.

19:14.120 --> 19:29.900
And so I started tapping them and created the fanzine Mirage, in addition to a $40 surplus mini-graph found in an old store, which I still own, by the way, and which still works.

19:31.780 --> 19:35.560
I was able to start putting out a fanzine called Mirage.

19:36.720 --> 19:42.640
The fanzine was successful because of its high quality, and it led into a small publishing company, Mirage Press.

19:44.400 --> 19:50.620
I was serious and constructive at the same time that everybody else was being just sort of kid hobbyist.

19:51.120 --> 20:01.560
I really had a magazine that discussed the literature, discussed the writers and so on past and present, and a time when very few of these were coming out.

20:02.200 --> 20:08.420
And so I attracted a rather large audience of collectors and professional writers and artists and so on.

20:08.420 --> 20:27.040
And I was able to create out of that the Mirage Press, which started off, again, as mini-graphed publications and then later grew as capital grew into a hardcover and paperback, quality paperback publishing house.

20:29.100 --> 20:32.440
Chalker says that Mirage Press was successful from the start.

20:33.600 --> 20:38.000
I started off with a bibliography of H.P. Lovecraft, which I did myself.

20:39.020 --> 21:00.220
Put it together, mini-graphed it with the help of Auguste Aralind, who owned the rights to the H.P. Lovecraft material at the time, and sold it for what in 1960 was a horrendous fee of a $1.

21:00.220 --> 21:03.080
And we sold a hundred of them.

21:05.040 --> 21:09.820
Mirage Press publishes non-fiction materials such as bibliographies and critical studies of authors.

21:10.640 --> 21:12.960
Chalker leaves the publishing of fiction to the large companies.

21:14.200 --> 21:20.380
You can't compete with double-dates, I'm a chooster and so on, for the good stuff in fiction.

21:21.200 --> 21:35.100
And although I did do a little bit of fiction, getting into prints and books of work that I thought was very, very neglected, you really have to promote fiction.

21:36.240 --> 21:44.060
Whereas non-fiction and reference material is always, there's always a heavy market and there's been a growing market for it.

21:44.600 --> 21:46.800
And so I concentrated in that end.

21:47.620 --> 21:58.380
And we came up with some rather successful books, Guide to Middle-Earth, which in its Valentine's form, which I still own a piece of, is still selling well on Atlas of Fantasy.

22:01.900 --> 22:06.920
We did three books on sword and sorcery fiction before the comic books discovered Conan.

22:08.880 --> 22:22.360
And occasionally we did rather odd materials such as a collection of all of the Ferdinand fake hoot, bad puns that have been published over the years, this kind of thing.

22:23.460 --> 22:28.680
Mostly though we were serious reference works and we still have a number of them that are standard.

22:30.380 --> 22:32.300
Next time, more with Jack Chalker.

22:40.340 --> 22:48.960
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show, a production of the Permian Basin Science Fiction Association, produced in conjunction with Odessa College in Odessa, Texas.

23:31.920 --> 23:34.940
The Science Fiction Radio Show

23:34.940 --> 23:36.180
So stay with us.

23:51.980 --> 23:57.360
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and fantasy.

24:00.020 --> 24:01.700
And here are your hosts.

24:06.400 --> 24:07.620
This is David Cruz.

24:07.880 --> 24:08.460
And Daryl A.

24:08.680 --> 24:13.800
Jack Chalker's reputation was greatly enhanced by the popular, well-world series of novels.

24:14.540 --> 24:19.280
Now he's at work on a new series, one which will have four books in it, entitled The Four Lords of the Diamond.

24:20.080 --> 24:24.820
Two novels have been published so far. The first is called Lilith and the second Cerberus.

24:25.560 --> 24:26.960
Chalker comments on the story.

24:28.640 --> 24:34.540
It has a tremendous number of the elements that I have become known for.

24:34.720 --> 24:38.640
It has a lot of new material as well. It has a lot of political commentary.

24:39.140 --> 24:41.440
It has a lot of social commentary in it.

24:42.040 --> 24:50.800
It has also slam bang action, Machiavellian intrigue and everything else because nobody's going to read your message if you don't entertain first.

24:52.260 --> 24:55.160
As Chalker says, the books have a lot of excitement in them.

24:55.420 --> 25:03.260
In the opening pages of Lilith, the first book in the series, a tremendously powerful alien robot penetrates a top secret military installation on Earth.

25:03.580 --> 25:08.100
The robot's discovered, but he escapes and heads for a planetary system called the Warden Diamond.

25:08.680 --> 25:10.360
The Earth government sends its top agent.

25:12.000 --> 25:18.720
These are four worlds in one system that are basically a prison planet series.

25:20.300 --> 25:31.520
You get dropped on there and the foundation idea which appealed to me an awful lot is that alien race discovers us before we discover them.

25:31.520 --> 25:35.880
The human society decides that it can't win a war against us.

25:36.700 --> 25:43.460
Maybe they're just not as many of them or there's technological problems or something like that.

25:44.200 --> 25:52.080
So they study us and they discover that as in all human societies there is this massive criminal syndicate.

25:53.080 --> 26:06.640
And that this criminal syndicate leaders are mostly imprisoned for life on the Warden Diamond, these four worlds.

26:07.260 --> 26:17.960
So what the aliens do is they contact these bitter super-cruts and they take out a contract on human civilization.

26:19.820 --> 26:23.240
The agent can't land on any of the four worlds of the Warden Diamond.

26:23.780 --> 26:28.020
A tiny organism on these worlds enters the body and makes a person a virtual prisoner.

26:28.500 --> 26:32.980
Right. If you try to leave you die a painful death. There seems to be no cure for it either.

26:33.600 --> 26:40.360
So what the agent does is have his personality implanted into four separate bodies and these bodies are sent to each of the worlds.

26:40.800 --> 26:44.460
And he monitors what is happening through a computer hookup orbiting the Warden system.

26:45.420 --> 26:58.120
Part of what the book is about is that we have a surrogate him down on each of these worlds who starts off pretty much are almost identical to him.

26:59.040 --> 27:04.120
And he's following this whole thing with his whole system of values, beliefs and so on.

27:04.640 --> 27:09.920
And he's watching these surrogates change into quite different people.

27:10.860 --> 27:16.480
And it begins to eat away at his own sense of values, his own sense of duty.

27:17.580 --> 27:27.620
As a matter of fact, in the third book he begins to realize that the people who sent him there on this mission anticipated this.

27:28.160 --> 27:38.460
And that his computer detective aide we had dialogues with and discusses everything with may be more than that, it may be something of a watchdog.

27:40.480 --> 27:47.440
Chalker promises an exciting ending when the agent struggles with his own newly discovered values with the computer and with the aliens.

28:19.920 --> 28:35.040
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show, a production of the Permian Basin Science Fiction Association produced in conjunction with Odessa College in Odessa, Texas.

28:39.920 --> 29:03.600
Thanks for watching!
