Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

00:28.160 --> 00:33.520
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and fantasy.

00:36.520 --> 00:37.880
And here are your hosts.

00:42.300 --> 00:43.300
This is Daryl Lane.

00:43.400 --> 00:43.980
And Bill Vernon.

00:44.340 --> 00:47.020
Gordon R. Dixon is one of the old-time professionals in science fiction.

00:47.340 --> 00:49.440
He's been writing this stuff full-time for over 30 years.

00:49.600 --> 00:53.860
The size and uncountable number of short stories, he's published such novels as Dorsi, The

00:53.860 --> 00:56.980
Pritcher Mass, The Dragon in the George, and The Star Sailors.

00:57.320 --> 01:00.960
He's also won Hugo and Nibbula awards for his science fiction, and he served as president

01:00.960 --> 01:02.320
of the Science Fiction Writers of America.

01:02.320 --> 01:04.880
We asked Dixon if he'd always been a full-time writer.

01:05.740 --> 01:06.220
Yeah.

01:09.640 --> 01:14.360
I went effectively out of... I just started at the beginning.

01:14.520 --> 01:16.180
I didn't really know anything about a writer, actually.

01:19.260 --> 01:26.780
I entered the University of Minnesota in 1939 when I was 15 years old, and began to work

01:26.780 --> 01:30.400
toward a degree with a major in creative writing.

01:32.440 --> 01:39.000
And World War II came along before I was able to get my BA.

01:40.560 --> 01:43.500
So I was out for three or four years.

01:43.740 --> 01:44.960
I forget which, something like that.

01:45.040 --> 01:46.660
And I went back and spent another two years.

01:46.740 --> 01:47.720
I went into graduate school.

01:48.780 --> 01:52.760
At the time, it's about the only time in my life when I ever considered doing anything

01:52.760 --> 01:53.380
but writing.

01:53.380 --> 02:00.680
I was playing with the idea then of holding down a teaching job, going on and getting

02:00.680 --> 02:06.580
my doctorate in English and teaching, and doing the writing on the side.

02:07.740 --> 02:09.760
After World War II, we were all hypersensitive.

02:10.840 --> 02:13.260
Everybody was very cool-headed.

02:14.560 --> 02:17.000
Let's have his nonsense over with.

02:17.320 --> 02:18.400
Get down and get the work someplace.

02:19.420 --> 02:21.720
And luckily, I came out of that, and said, this is silly.

02:21.720 --> 02:23.820
I'd never intended to do anything but writing.

02:24.360 --> 02:27.760
Instead of having a teaching paper for the writing, why not make the writing paper for the writing?

02:28.660 --> 02:33.680
So I simply dived out of graduate school into full-time writing for the magazines.

02:43.300 --> 02:46.480
Dixon published his first story in the Science Fiction Magazine around 1950.

02:46.960 --> 02:48.980
And by writing for the Pulps, he was able to support himself.

02:48.980 --> 02:56.620
So actually, I dived in and kept myself in full-time writing for the magazines for about

02:57.600 --> 03:02.980
three or four years, and then somewhere about 1954, I did my first Science Fiction novel.

03:04.180 --> 03:07.980
So I didn't full-time have the writer since 1950.

03:08.660 --> 03:10.120
Now, I told things before that.

03:10.900 --> 03:18.340
I told a magazine piece, I think, as early as 1942, and I had something in my magazine

03:18.340 --> 03:25.420
that was a short-short story in a magazine text from a Minneapolis paper, and I'd been in the Toronto Star Weekly,

03:25.680 --> 03:31.020
which was a magazine supplement that went along with the Toronto Star Journal.

03:32.260 --> 03:32.660
Star Journal?

03:34.300 --> 03:35.640
Can't remember the name of the newspaper.

03:36.800 --> 03:39.780
Dixon reveals more about his background and his literary preferences.

03:40.400 --> 03:43.060
You see, the thing is that I always intended to be a writer.

03:44.040 --> 03:50.040
And about the first 30 years of my life, I was simply looking for the type of thing I wanted to write.

03:51.200 --> 03:52.640
I kept my faith on poetry.

03:53.340 --> 03:59.460
If I'd been born in the late 19th century, I would have been at home, because I would have done long-nourished

03:59.460 --> 04:05.380
at points like Idle with the King, you know, Tennyson, and I was on things like that.

04:06.660 --> 04:11.880
As it is within an unported age, and I finally ended up saying,

04:11.980 --> 04:15.900
well, to do what I want to do, I'm going to have to use the medium of just those alone.

04:17.260 --> 04:23.520
And then simply because magazines were putting butter on the table, and I found out I liked science fiction best,

04:24.360 --> 04:30.060
I liked writing science fiction best, I ended up doing faithfully nothing but science fiction.

04:31.120 --> 04:36.620
And as I did this, I came to realize the possibilities of that particular field for what I wanted to do.

04:37.320 --> 04:43.040
What Dixon wanted to do was an ambitious undertaking to publish a series of 12 novels dealing with man's ethical evolution.

04:43.360 --> 04:46.140
He's still working on the series, called The Child Cycle.

04:46.460 --> 04:50.660
Some of the novels ended on Necromancer, Dorsi, and The Tactics of Mistake.

04:51.080 --> 04:52.820
We'll talk more with Gordon Dixon next time.

05:00.200 --> 05:05.260
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show, production of the Permian Basin Science Fiction Association,

05:05.900 --> 05:08.800
produced in conjunction with Odessa College in Odessa, Texas.

06:00.160 --> 06:01.900
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

06:17.660 --> 06:23.040
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and fantasy.

06:25.660 --> 06:27.380
And here are your hosts.

06:31.800 --> 06:33.620
This is Bill Vernon and Daryl Lange.

06:33.840 --> 06:37.060
Gordon Dixon has written highly popular science fiction for over three decades,

06:37.600 --> 06:42.960
but during that time he's been most concerned with one major vision, a series of novels called The Child Cycle.

06:43.240 --> 06:45.060
The series will be at least 12 novels long.

06:45.440 --> 06:51.180
The books will be set in the past, the present, and the future, and they will deal with what Dixon calls the ethical evolution of man.

06:51.500 --> 06:55.160
Some of the novels have already been written, Dorsi being perhaps the best known of them.

06:55.160 --> 07:00.660
Dixon says that when he began writing science fiction, he realized the possibilities that the field offered him to pursue his vision.

07:01.520 --> 07:08.940
And of course what I wanted to do is now take in shape, long since 20 years ago, as The Child Cycle of novels,

07:09.520 --> 07:12.400
which is, when it's done, will cover a thousand years.

07:13.720 --> 07:23.120
There'll be three historical novels starting with one about Sir John Hawthorne, who was an Englishman in the 13th century,

07:23.120 --> 07:29.540
who ended up as Captain General of the Military Forces for Florence, Italy,

07:31.420 --> 07:43.200
and will end in the 23rd century with The Child, the novel from which the whole series takes its name.

07:44.600 --> 07:50.880
And the whole series effectively, the stories don't chronologically follow each other.

07:52.200 --> 08:00.740
They're connected thematically, and what they represent is sort of a literary thematic argument, something that has never been done before actually,

08:02.740 --> 08:10.640
which argues, the philosophical point in fact, that we're undergoing evolution right now.

08:10.840 --> 08:12.840
It's not physical evolution or mental evolution.

08:13.900 --> 08:15.640
There's no really good word for it.

08:15.660 --> 08:18.080
You would call it spiritual evolution, but that isn't right.

08:18.080 --> 08:19.480
Either it's nathical evolution.

08:20.280 --> 08:21.660
We're of necessity.

08:21.980 --> 08:24.960
We're evolving what I call a responsible human being.

08:25.060 --> 08:33.780
We're sort of halfway there from the time of the 13th, from the viewpoint of the 13th century, toward the 23rd.

08:33.780 --> 08:38.320
We're halfway to developing the responsible human being.

08:39.240 --> 08:42.540
Dixon explains what he means by the responsible human being.

08:43.360 --> 08:54.760
If you assume that old insanity is going to be brought under control unless civilization goes crash within the next 50 or 100 years,

08:55.020 --> 08:59.660
not a lot sooner, that is going to give you a population of sane people,

08:59.780 --> 09:06.760
but even a population of sane people can have individuals who for their own purposes are willing to destroy things.

09:07.560 --> 09:15.360
Now, back in the days of the Flint acts and the Stone Club,

09:17.120 --> 09:22.240
a particular cheap man decided to run wild and start bobbing people over the head.

09:22.300 --> 09:27.280
He could probably kill two or three others before everybody ganged up on him and stopped him.

09:28.060 --> 09:41.260
That's escalated up to our time where somebody who knows how can set up a laboratory in the basement and blow up a large sized city or part of a state.

09:42.740 --> 09:47.080
You extrapolate the sort of destructive possibility.

09:47.360 --> 09:56.260
You see that within, well, probably less than the 300 to 500 years I give us,

09:57.780 --> 10:01.600
you're going to have a situation where any individual can destroy the whole race,

10:01.980 --> 10:05.520
unless some such sense of responsibility is developed.

10:06.740 --> 10:13.820
And what the historical novels do and the contemporary novels do is what a good hard science fiction story does,

10:14.180 --> 10:19.940
and that is they lay out the evidence of what we know and then extrapolate forward from there saying,

10:20.100 --> 10:26.720
all right, if this and this and this is so and we know it to be so, then doesn't this develop from it?

10:27.140 --> 10:31.480
And if I'm wrong, it might have others as point out for that wrong.

10:34.180 --> 10:40.140
And so the whole cycle becomes essentially sort of one large science fiction story,

10:41.000 --> 10:46.220
even though it covers historical contemporary and your novels.

10:47.080 --> 10:48.880
More with Gordon Dixon next time.

10:55.940 --> 10:58.600
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show,

10:58.820 --> 11:01.600
production of the Permian Basin Science Fiction Association,

11:01.880 --> 11:04.820
produced in conjunction with Odessa College in Odessa, Texas.

11:18.880 --> 11:45.860
Thank you.

12:21.100 --> 12:25.360
Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

12:41.320 --> 12:46.700
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and fantasy.

12:49.720 --> 12:51.180
And here are your hosts.

12:56.320 --> 12:58.140
This is Daryl Lane and Bill Vernon.

12:58.520 --> 13:03.760
Dorsi, the first book in Gordon Dixon's projected 12 novel series called The Child Cycle, was published in 1959.

13:04.060 --> 13:09.140
Dorsi concerns a world of humans who are the ultimate warriors, much like the Spartans of ancient Greece,

13:09.260 --> 13:12.980
they train from childhood to be formidable fighters and battle strategists.

13:13.360 --> 13:17.820
Since Dorsi is one of Dixon's most popular works, he's gotten the reputation of being a militarist,

13:17.820 --> 13:19.260
a writer concerned mainly with war.

13:19.400 --> 13:21.760
Who asked Dixon if he thought this estimate was a fair one?

13:47.820 --> 13:55.360
Dixon, the person of people we can look up in history books, the 20th century will show them at work in our century.

13:56.320 --> 14:02.960
The future ones show them in the projected and problematical future, but the warrior is only one of three types,

14:03.520 --> 14:06.560
all of which equally necessary.

14:07.820 --> 14:13.740
Now the reason the emphasis on the military is there is for two reasons.

14:13.740 --> 14:24.540
One is this copy, the Eye of the Publishers, and they package the books as military-oriented books.

14:25.580 --> 14:34.060
And in fact the ones that dealt with warrior types like Donald Reign and the First One, Dorsi, where Donald Reign is a warrior type,

14:35.980 --> 14:40.860
were in little duty to it that way, but then they began publishing whole things in this way.

14:42.400 --> 14:48.760
That is part of it. The other part of it is that all the cycle must be sound, must be watertight.

14:49.960 --> 14:54.860
Is that the military elements in there are justified, are logicalized.

14:56.680 --> 15:02.340
So it's not, I don't blame people for being let astray in this particular fashion,

15:03.020 --> 15:06.860
but if they will look closely at the cycle, they will see it is true.

15:07.920 --> 15:14.260
And about the only people I have any quarrel with are those who, without reading the things, simply make the assumption

15:15.160 --> 15:21.900
that this is a military-oriented series of books.

15:30.100 --> 15:36.040
When Dixon published Dorsi in 1959, he hadn't yet thought of the idea of a large cycle in which that novel would only be a part.

15:36.040 --> 15:41.820
He says the idea of the cycle came to him when he went to the Milford Science Fiction Conference in Pennsylvania in 1960.

16:06.040 --> 16:11.220
Getting breath in, it's a matter of getting breath out. You swell up with air that you can't exhale.

16:13.420 --> 16:18.080
And your adrenaline level goes off the top of the map. You're physically in capacity,

16:18.340 --> 16:23.780
but your mind is galloping. Now we lay off of it with defectively, and there was nothing to be done until dawn

16:24.520 --> 16:31.080
at which time other people would be up and they could drive me to the doctor or clinic or whatever.

16:32.760 --> 16:38.700
And so I just had nothing to do but sit there for five hours and wait for the sun to rise.

16:39.300 --> 16:50.560
And in that time I worked out the patterns of this cycle completely, from soup canots with every book in its place

16:50.560 --> 16:58.320
or rather every... I shouldn't say every book because the numbers of books have doubled because of the size of what's being done,

16:58.320 --> 17:06.080
but it's a case of the original books more or less being split down the middle, the same, because they're too big to publish as it's shown.

17:06.720 --> 17:09.160
We'll continue talking with Gordon Dixon on our next show.

17:16.440 --> 17:21.880
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show, production of the Permian Basin Science Fiction Association,

17:22.160 --> 17:25.120
produced in conjunction with Odessa College in Odessa, Texas.

17:30.940 --> 17:33.380
And so we're going to be talking about the science fiction, which is a very interesting story.

17:33.380 --> 17:36.440
And so we're going to be talking about the science fiction, which is a very interesting story.

17:36.940 --> 17:43.240
And so we're going to be talking about the science fiction, which is a very interesting story.

17:43.240 --> 18:12.400
Music

18:29.900 --> 18:35.880
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and fantasy.

18:38.560 --> 18:40.240
And here are your hosts.

18:44.700 --> 18:45.760
This is Bill Vernon.

18:45.940 --> 18:46.460
And Daryl Lane.

18:46.660 --> 18:51.560
Science fiction author Gordon Dixon has been working on his ambitious child cycle for over 20 years.

18:51.960 --> 18:56.660
When completed, the cycle will encompass at least 12 novels and will describe the ethical evolution of man.

18:56.940 --> 19:00.480
Dorsi, the first novel written in the series, though not the first chronologically,

19:00.940 --> 19:04.160
was published in a serial in Astounding magazine in 1959.

19:04.680 --> 19:07.860
We asked Dixon if his overall plan is still based on a 12 novel series.

19:08.700 --> 19:15.180
Yes, the original plan was for six novels.

19:22.280 --> 19:23.880
No, for nine novels.

19:24.160 --> 19:24.600
Pardon me.

19:25.780 --> 19:31.260
Three historical, three late in the 20th century, and three late in the future.

19:33.400 --> 19:44.800
Because I started on the future length first, it was there I first discovered that each book was going to be too big to get into one set of covers.

19:45.380 --> 19:51.380
Also, to begin with, with Dorsi and Soldier Astronaut and Necromancer and things like that,

19:51.420 --> 20:01.140
I was up against the fact that publishers refused to print category fiction in lengths of much more than 100,000 words at that time.

20:02.300 --> 20:12.280
Remember this, the first big book to come out actually was Frank Herbert's Dune, which andedates Dorsi, which happened earlier,

20:14.320 --> 20:17.060
about, I think, four or six years, something like that.

20:17.060 --> 20:27.660
And Dune was printed only because one editor in particular practically, well,

20:27.840 --> 20:34.780
made his job online and practically offered to shoot up the publishing house of Leslie, what after it.

20:35.220 --> 20:41.800
And they chewed their fingernails, you know, because there's a great deal of money involved in printing a very large book.

20:43.820 --> 20:49.920
This is still the case, even with paperbacks, even with paperback, it's very expensive to do a big take book.

20:51.440 --> 20:56.840
So these things had to be cut, pardon me, I mean, they had to be divided into smaller chunks.

20:57.740 --> 21:03.040
And the result was I ended up with three historical, three contemporary, and six forward.

21:03.760 --> 21:19.940
Now, of that six forward, Final Encyclopedia, at 1400 pages, is so big that Child, which could have been, see, that Final Encyclopedia is an element novel.

21:20.840 --> 21:30.800
The last one, the ultimate one, is Child. And obviously, if Final Encyclopedia is 1400, Child would have run close to 2000 manuscript pages,

21:30.800 --> 21:39.460
which is far too big, so I'm had to split that again. So effectively, what we have now is not 12, but 13 novels.

21:47.840 --> 21:54.220
What about the works that are set in the past, the historical novels? Will Dixon stick to his original plan for a set of three?

21:54.800 --> 22:07.260
I think there's a pretty good chance, except in the case of Hawkwood. Now, and the problem with that is that Sir John Hawkwood, the actual man, lived a very long time by medieval standards.

22:07.920 --> 22:17.080
And astonishingly long time when you just stopped to think that most of his adult life was spent in hand-to-hand combat, wearing armor.

22:21.420 --> 22:30.040
He actually lived into his 70s, and he covered in that time, what by modern standards would have been three or four lifetimes.

22:30.760 --> 22:40.080
He starts out in Cipollet-Headigan, England, which is out in the Moon Docks of Essex in his time, literally when Essex was mainly forest.

22:41.460 --> 22:46.740
And he ended up in Florence, Italy, which at that time was the center of western civilization.

22:48.900 --> 22:59.720
So effectively he traveled in subjective time, about 150 to 180 years, in terms of moving forward with the pattern of civilization.

23:00.700 --> 23:02.420
More with Gordon Dixon next time.

23:09.460 --> 23:18.380

Gordon Dixon has been turning out popular science fiction for over three decades.

24:46.380 --> 24:49.780
During that time he's published around 40 novels and over 150 short stories.

24:49.940 --> 24:55.280
And he's presently at work on his massive series The Child Cycle, which will be around 13 novels when completed.

24:55.700 --> 24:59.020
We ask Dixon if he gets tired of writing, and if it's hard for him to write.

24:59.580 --> 25:03.000
Any art requires an instant amount of work.

25:04.460 --> 25:13.960
And he wasn't said that the definition of art was the taking of intimate things or words about a fact.

25:14.940 --> 25:24.420
But the point is, the person being that enjoys it or he doesn't do it, I'm fascinated with the work I do.

25:28.480 --> 25:38.380
You wonder for example how a concert pianist can practice five hours a day, week after week, month after month, year after year.

25:39.220 --> 25:48.880
You think if you're a non-pianoplayer or if you had piano playing lessons pushed on you and didn't like them when you were young, you think.

25:48.880 --> 25:58.500
But this must be a self-imposed agony. It is. It's a sheer pleasure for him to get things just right.

25:59.640 --> 26:03.300
And this of course is the battle cry of the artist, to get things just right.

26:04.200 --> 26:11.780
When we asked Dixon if he has to do a lot of rewriting, he alluded to a book he had just finished and that should be published soon, The Final Encyclopedia.

26:11.780 --> 26:15.700
I write and rewrite and rewrite and rewrite again.

26:16.320 --> 26:26.480
This last book, sections of it were written once and barely touched again.

26:27.060 --> 26:36.280
Other sections were written in numbable time. I really couldn't tell you how many. Ten or more. Ten, fifteen times. To get it just right.

26:37.860 --> 26:46.280
I can't reread anything I've written without picking up a pencil and starting to collect and improve it. It's instinctive.

26:46.660 --> 26:52.260
Most writers have this kind of reaction. Although some rewrite, more some rewrite.

26:52.860 --> 27:05.060
There is a type of writer that doesn't rewrite and instead sits and does nothing for a long time and sits down and does it just the way he or she wants it.

27:05.060 --> 27:11.400
And that possibly is the hardest work of all because it's all being done in him. I do it on paper.

27:11.660 --> 27:20.620
Of course, the fact that I use a computer to write with Valdez makes it that much easier. Makes it that much faster.

27:21.560 --> 27:27.700
Dixon says that science fiction has developed over the years. A natural progression from the hardware stories of the late 20s and early 30s.

27:27.700 --> 27:43.080
What was printed in the late 1920s and early 1930s went through a period of development when John Gamble took over as founding and the concept of the hard science fiction story.

27:43.640 --> 27:54.700
And also something else, the idea story, which is essentially a thematic science fiction story, began with John in the 30s.

27:54.700 --> 28:03.300
And that's clearly developed and gone on. They were recently hardware stories. Originally science fiction.

28:05.420 --> 28:24.680
It's gone from hard science to essentially soft science. In other words, the subject, the scientific element, has gone from physics and chemistry to rather Winston physics and chemistry into psychology and sociology.

28:26.880 --> 28:40.180
And with the emergence in the 60s of the excellent crop of women writers who have almost dominated the field since then, we've had the introduction of caricatural histories.

28:41.880 --> 28:47.000
They have become much more stories of human interest.

28:49.580 --> 28:57.160
As has been pointed out, we've been exploring the inner universe as much as we've been exploring the outer universe, perhaps more.

29:04.760 --> 29:13.640
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show, production of the Permian Basin Science Fiction Association, produced in conjunction with Odessa College in Odessa, Texas.

29:17.000 --> 29:43.400
And as always, thanks for watching.
