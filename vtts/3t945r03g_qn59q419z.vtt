[Music.]

00:23.673 --> 00:48.887
[Tom Turbeville]: Hello and welcome to Veterans of the Valley. I'm Tom Turbeville Alfred Whitey Birdwell was a Sherman tank driver in World War II's European theater

00:49.103 --> 00:54.272
[Tom Turbeville]: after D-Day, but during the final push in the Battle of the Bulge and until victory in Europe.

00:54.792 --> 01:01.003
[Tom Turbeville]: He was overseas just more than a year, but probably covered more miles per day served than just about anyone.

01:01.023 --> 01:09.316
[Tom Turbeville]: He proudly recalls when he drove the first American tank over the Rhine River for the third armored spearheads, a Purple Heart recipient.

01:09.336 --> 01:14.605
[Tom Turbeville]: He drove a tank every day, except for those 10 days that he was laid up because of shrapnel wounds.

01:14.922 --> 01:16.387
[Tom Turbeville]: now 91 years old.

01:16.407 --> 01:21.583
[Tom Turbeville]: His is another fascinating story of World War II service that we are honored to tell.

01:21.683 --> 01:24.732
[Tom Turbeville]: So welcome, Whitey Birdwell, to Veterans of the Valley.

01:25.174 --> 01:27.200
[Tom Turbeville]: Whitey, it is a pleasure to have you.

01:27.240 --> 01:28.223
[Tom Turbeville]: I got to meet you

01:28.760 --> 01:33.767
[Tom Turbeville]: back on May the 1st when we were honored to take the Lone Star Honor Flight trip to Washington.

01:33.807 --> 01:37.692
[Tom Turbeville]: And that was a great trip that we've been able to review here on Veterans of the Valley.

01:37.752 --> 01:40.957
[Tom Turbeville]: But we're here today to talk about your life and your service.

01:41.778 --> 01:42.399
[Tom Turbeville]: You're a Texan.

01:42.539 --> 01:43.761
[Tom Turbeville]: You grew up in Henderson.

01:44.061 --> 01:44.682
[Whitey Birdwell]: Absolutely.

01:44.982 --> 01:45.543
[Tom Turbeville]: Absolutely.

01:46.224 --> 01:49.469
[Tom Turbeville]: Sort of take us through, you know, from Henderson.

01:49.529 --> 01:52.833
[Tom Turbeville]: And you worked for a while but couldn't find steady work.

01:52.953 --> 01:56.458
[Tom Turbeville]: So you said the day after you got laid off from a job, you got drafted.

01:56.518 --> 01:56.979
[Tom Turbeville]: Is that right?

01:57.179 --> 01:57.720
[Whitey Birdwell]: I...

01:59.742 --> 02:04.770
[Whitey Birdwell]: All I had was just neighborhood work up until that time.

02:05.952 --> 02:15.969
[Whitey Birdwell]: And when the defense work started, we went down to Beaumont and went to work for Loomis Company where we were making beauty dying for the tires.

02:15.989 --> 02:16.229
[Tom Turbeville]: Right.

02:16.790 --> 02:24.062
[Whitey Birdwell]: And we built that plant there and we finished it up on the day that I finished my job.

02:24.683 --> 02:27.908
[Whitey Birdwell]: on the afternoon then I got my draft card the next morning.

02:29.390 --> 02:37.080
[Whitey Birdwell]: So I went into Houston and they swore me in and so I waited six weeks and I went down to Fort Sam Houston and they put me in uniform.

02:37.962 --> 02:43.009
[Tom Turbeville]: Well you were married and had two kids at the time and you were only making about $1.10 an hour at your job.

02:43.750 --> 02:46.914
[Tom Turbeville]: So this was probably better for you to be in the Army.

02:47.074 --> 02:49.037
[Tom Turbeville]: You went into the Army in March of 43.

02:49.388 --> 02:53.213
[Tom Turbeville]: overseas to Europe, January the 1st, 1944.

02:53.514 --> 02:59.702
[Tom Turbeville]: And a fascinating part of your family history is that you had five brothers and they all served in World War II.

02:59.802 --> 03:00.043
[Tom Turbeville]: Right.

03:00.123 --> 03:00.984
[Tom Turbeville]: All six of you, right?

03:01.004 --> 03:01.224
[Tom Turbeville]: Right.

03:01.585 --> 03:02.466
[Tom Turbeville]: Served in World War II.

03:02.707 --> 03:06.432
[Tom Turbeville]: And two are, you and one other are still alive today, is that right?

03:06.452 --> 03:07.233
[Whitey Birdwell]: Yeah, I got three of us.

03:07.573 --> 03:08.815
[Whitey Birdwell]: Three of you are still.

03:09.605 --> 03:14.230
[Whitey Birdwell]: My brother just served in North Africa, and the one that was in the Navy, the baby brother.

03:14.510 --> 03:14.771
[Tom Turbeville]: Right.

03:15.111 --> 03:16.272
[Tom Turbeville]: Still living.

03:16.292 --> 03:18.034
[Tom Turbeville]: As we said in the opening, you were a tank driver.

03:18.234 --> 03:19.576
[Tom Turbeville]: That's what you were trained to do.

03:20.256 --> 03:25.302
[Tom Turbeville]: You drove lead tank for 1st Platoon, the 3rd Armored Division, and they're called the Spearheads.

03:25.362 --> 03:27.504
[Tom Turbeville]: Talk a little bit about the Spearheads in that unit.

03:27.524 --> 03:38.616
[Whitey Birdwell]: Well, our job was to go through the German lines and cut them in two and break their communications, and the other trooper to come behind and clean up.

03:38.866 --> 03:40.007
[Whitey Birdwell]: And that's what we did.

03:40.027 --> 03:40.268
[Whitey Birdwell]: Right.

03:40.728 --> 03:45.654
[Whitey Birdwell]: So that was the, they told us that when you get started, don't stop.

03:45.674 --> 03:49.578
[Whitey Birdwell]: Don't stop for anything because it's just like a wave of water in front of a car.

03:50.219 --> 03:53.022
[Whitey Birdwell]: When you stop and it lashes back on you, it's hard to start again.

03:53.042 --> 03:54.964
[Whitey Birdwell]: So drive through, just keep driving.

03:55.004 --> 03:55.725
[Tom Turbeville]: Just keep driving.

03:55.925 --> 03:57.106
[Tom Turbeville]: Don't stop or you'll get stuck.

03:57.407 --> 04:00.350
[Whitey Birdwell]: When you get them moving, move them.

04:00.370 --> 04:05.055
[Tom Turbeville]: I'm always fascinated by veterans who did serve in the European theater about how they got there.

04:05.095 --> 04:05.616
[Tom Turbeville]: And you went,

04:06.085 --> 04:09.690
[Tom Turbeville]: aboard a converted luxury ship or passenger ship, the Queen Mary.

04:09.850 --> 04:11.031
[Whitey Birdwell]: Oh, the Queen Mary, yes.

04:11.772 --> 04:12.513
[Whitey Birdwell]: That sure did.

04:12.753 --> 04:13.354
[Whitey Birdwell]: Yeah.

04:13.374 --> 04:17.219
[Whitey Birdwell]: And it was, I don't know how many troops were on it, but it was from wall to wall.

04:18.381 --> 04:24.188
[Whitey Birdwell]: And kind of hard to eat that limey cooking and drink the coffee and tea mixed together.

04:25.610 --> 04:26.110
[Whitey Birdwell]: We made it.

04:26.451 --> 04:27.132
[Tom Turbeville]: Somehow you did it.

04:27.152 --> 04:28.253
[Tom Turbeville]: You left from Boston Harbor.

04:28.974 --> 04:31.016
[Tom Turbeville]: And how long did it take you, a week?

04:32.198 --> 04:33.219
[Whitey Birdwell]: It took six days.

04:33.299 --> 04:33.900
[Whitey Birdwell]: Six days?

04:34.100 --> 04:34.641
[Whitey Birdwell]: In England.

04:34.908 --> 04:35.208
[Whitey Birdwell]: Right.

04:35.329 --> 04:38.373
[Whitey Birdwell]: And on the seventh day it was in Lahar, France.

04:39.294 --> 04:44.661
[Tom Turbeville]: So you landed in England, you took the train down and actually took an LST across the channel.

04:44.701 --> 04:44.901
[Tom Turbeville]: Yes.

04:45.562 --> 04:47.265
[Tom Turbeville]: And landed in Lahar, France.

04:47.325 --> 04:47.585
[Tom Turbeville]: Yes.

04:48.206 --> 04:51.390
[Tom Turbeville]: First you thought you were going to North Africa, is that right?

04:51.410 --> 04:53.893
[Whitey Birdwell]: No, they said, well, in training.

04:54.014 --> 04:54.494
[Tom Turbeville]: In training.

04:55.055 --> 04:58.840
[Whitey Birdwell]: But they didn't know how the war was moving and so when they found out that

04:59.832 --> 05:09.186
[Whitey Birdwell]: North Africa was getting along just fine, and they decided they would send us over to Germany and just hit the heart of the Germans there in Germany and help close the gate on them.

05:09.506 --> 05:10.487
[Tom Turbeville]: Right.

05:10.507 --> 05:23.687
[Tom Turbeville]: Talk a little bit more about your mission and the service of your particular mission because you were in Lahare, France, and your job, like you said, was to cut through the German lines and just sort of disrupt things and band them together.

05:23.707 --> 05:25.289
[Tom Turbeville]: Talk a little bit more specifically about that.

05:25.309 --> 05:26.731
[Whitey Birdwell]: Well, it's just like plying a field.

05:26.751 --> 05:28.934
[Whitey Birdwell]: When you drive through, the Germans go this way.

05:29.235 --> 05:29.535
[Tom Turbeville]: Yes, sir.

05:29.903 --> 05:38.172
[Whitey Birdwell]: And then we had the fourth armored on one side of us, one E company on one side of us, and another company on the other side.

05:38.232 --> 05:41.936
[Whitey Birdwell]: And we just kind of plowed them in together.

05:42.016 --> 05:47.662
[Whitey Birdwell]: And then the rear echelon would come along and pick them up and send them back to the prison camp.

05:47.962 --> 05:48.422
[Tom Turbeville]: Right.

05:48.442 --> 05:51.045
[Tom Turbeville]: So they were the ones that were more in charge of taking them as prisoner.

05:51.445 --> 05:55.530
[Tom Turbeville]: You were the one that sort of banded them together and said, march along.

05:55.650 --> 05:59.674
[Whitey Birdwell]: Well, the only time that we took prisoners is when they gave up.

05:59.890 --> 06:00.852
[Whitey Birdwell]: on the front line.

06:00.872 --> 06:01.112
[Tom Turbeville]: Right.

06:01.372 --> 06:04.958
[Whitey Birdwell]: And we'd take their guns and their helmets and just send them back down the road.

06:05.258 --> 06:06.160
[Tom Turbeville]: Right.

06:06.180 --> 06:09.585
[Tom Turbeville]: You said at the time that you did encounter resistance.

06:09.786 --> 06:10.507
[Tom Turbeville]: Oh, yeah.

06:11.148 --> 06:14.493
[Tom Turbeville]: But those who wanted to surrender... Gave up.

06:14.974 --> 06:15.795
[Tom Turbeville]: They gave up.

06:15.815 --> 06:16.356
[Tom Turbeville]: They weren't ready.

06:16.596 --> 06:18.379
[Tom Turbeville]: They didn't want war anymore themselves.

06:18.399 --> 06:18.940
[Whitey Birdwell]: Home guards.

06:19.341 --> 06:19.862
[Tom Turbeville]: Yeah.

06:19.882 --> 06:23.047
[Whitey Birdwell]: There were people who were scripted in the Army as home guards.

06:23.327 --> 06:23.527
[Tom Turbeville]: Right.

06:23.968 --> 06:27.754
[Whitey Birdwell]: And the roughest one that we faced was the Hitler Youth and the SS.

06:27.937 --> 06:29.138
[Tom Turbeville]: Right.

06:29.158 --> 06:30.420
[Whitey Birdwell]: That was a reference.

06:30.440 --> 06:31.381
[Tom Turbeville]: Right, right.

06:31.681 --> 06:34.624
[Tom Turbeville]: Those are the ones that you had to give resistance back to.

06:34.884 --> 06:36.005
[Tom Turbeville]: Back to, yeah.

06:36.025 --> 06:36.886
[Tom Turbeville]: Right, right.

06:37.066 --> 06:39.829
[Tom Turbeville]: Because of, right.

06:41.972 --> 06:51.982
[Tom Turbeville]: Talk about, oh, you talked about your tank and how you would sort of camouflage your tank to keep the Germans from knowing exactly who you all were.

06:52.362 --> 06:53.944
[Tom Turbeville]: You had a little bit of a unique way of doing that.

06:55.915 --> 06:56.456
[Whitey Birdwell]: I don't know.

06:56.496 --> 07:03.364
[Whitey Birdwell]: We didn't do that so much as some of the other guys did who were in the holding position.

07:03.584 --> 07:03.784
[Whitey Birdwell]: Right.

07:03.804 --> 07:04.445
[Whitey Birdwell]: We've been moving.

07:04.505 --> 07:06.127
[Whitey Birdwell]: We didn't have time to do that.

07:06.167 --> 07:12.014
[Whitey Birdwell]: We just had the regular army color on it.

07:12.254 --> 07:12.495
[Tom Turbeville]: Right.

07:12.555 --> 07:13.676
[Whitey Birdwell]: But you had a piece of steel.

07:13.696 --> 07:14.337
[Whitey Birdwell]: The only time.

07:14.357 --> 07:16.319
[Whitey Birdwell]: Well, I had a piece of steel on the front of it.

07:16.459 --> 07:16.659
[Tom Turbeville]: Right.

07:16.699 --> 07:17.240
[Tom Turbeville]: That's what I meant.

07:17.280 --> 07:18.201
[Tom Turbeville]: Yeah, that's what I was talking about.

07:18.301 --> 07:23.087
[Whitey Birdwell]: When I got into the steel mill in Germany, I saw this piece of soft metal steel there.

07:23.776 --> 07:28.482
[Whitey Birdwell]: And it was pretty thick, and I asked the sergeant, I said, can you put that on the front of my tank to cover up that star?

07:28.843 --> 07:28.983
[Whitey Birdwell]: Uh-huh.

07:29.263 --> 07:33.549
[Whitey Birdwell]: He called the vehicle over there and picked it up and welded it on the front of the tank.

07:33.609 --> 07:38.716
[Whitey Birdwell]: My tank run like a mad watch with a tail up in there with that heavy piece of metal on the front.

07:38.736 --> 07:40.138
[Tom Turbeville]: Right, right.

07:40.158 --> 07:43.082
[Whitey Birdwell]: It really did the job because it had a lot of gouges in it.

07:43.483 --> 07:44.564
[Tom Turbeville]: Right.

07:45.466 --> 07:46.527
[Tom Turbeville]: Now, as a tank...

07:46.810 --> 07:48.072
[Tom Turbeville]: You drove the tank.

07:48.092 --> 07:49.373
[Tom Turbeville]: There were five in each tank, right?

07:49.433 --> 07:50.114
[Whitey Birdwell]: Five in each tank.

07:50.314 --> 07:50.915
[Tom Turbeville]: Right.

07:50.935 --> 07:56.121
[Tom Turbeville]: And you said that your entire brigade or your unit had about the firepower of 17 tanks, right?

07:56.221 --> 08:06.854
[Whitey Birdwell]: Well, yes, because we had five tanks on line, and we had the Air Force observer and the artillery observer in the tank, so we had two extra tanks.

08:07.155 --> 08:07.415
[Tom Turbeville]: Right.

08:07.795 --> 08:09.397
[Whitey Birdwell]: Had 17 in firepower.

08:09.598 --> 08:09.898
[Whitey Birdwell]: Right.

08:10.469 --> 08:12.833
[Tom Turbeville]: You are a receiver of the Purple Heart.

08:13.033 --> 08:16.499
[Tom Turbeville]: You did earn the Purple Heart, I guess, if that's the word for it.

08:16.520 --> 08:18.623
[Tom Turbeville]: I guess it's not something that people strive for.

08:18.643 --> 08:25.515
[Tom Turbeville]: But talk about the circumstances of how you were wounded because you were trying to help a fellow soldier.

08:25.756 --> 08:30.604
[Whitey Birdwell]: Well, they were sent up on a hill to observe.

08:31.563 --> 08:33.445
[Whitey Birdwell]: And we got up there, we didn't see anything.

08:33.505 --> 08:36.087
[Whitey Birdwell]: Of course, we took our field glasses and looked around.

08:37.028 --> 08:43.414
[Whitey Birdwell]: And the sister driver got out to throw hay on the tank to camouflage it.

08:44.034 --> 08:48.158
[Whitey Birdwell]: And that's when the mortar fire started coming in and cut his arm off.

08:48.178 --> 08:52.602
[Whitey Birdwell]: And so he was just in limbo out there, not knowing, you know, just crazy.

08:53.063 --> 08:58.768
[Whitey Birdwell]: When you get hit that way, I don't know how,

08:59.035 --> 09:05.503
[Whitey Birdwell]: Well, I don't know how you feel, I don't know how to explain it, except he was just out there in La La Land, suffering.

09:05.883 --> 09:09.007
[Whitey Birdwell]: So I jumped out of the tank and kept him in the foxhole there.

09:10.389 --> 09:22.524
[Whitey Birdwell]: So the mortar fire kept coming in and would hit on the side, and the ground was shaking, and I thought, well, the next one is gonna be in here on top of it and get both of us, so if I can get out and let them follow me, it would save him.

09:23.405 --> 09:25.768
[Whitey Birdwell]: So when I jumped out, I foot slipped on a,

09:26.862 --> 09:31.548
[Whitey Birdwell]: Bunch of hay, and I laid there, and that's when the mortar bar hit me.

09:31.568 --> 09:39.138
[Whitey Birdwell]: And I tell everybody, I say, well, you know which way I was going when I got shot, because where I got shot, but it just got me started, and I got out of there.

09:39.718 --> 09:42.542
[Tom Turbeville]: 129 pieces of shrapnel they took out of you, right?

09:42.982 --> 09:46.086
[Whitey Birdwell]: Put it in a little deal like that, and I lost it somewhere.

09:46.106 --> 09:46.627
[Tom Turbeville]: Yeah.

09:46.647 --> 09:47.368
[Whitey Birdwell]: My souvenir.

09:49.190 --> 09:52.735
[Tom Turbeville]: But you were able to get up and go to safety, though, right?

09:52.755 --> 09:53.856
[Whitey Birdwell]: It didn't cripple me.

09:53.876 --> 09:54.637
[Whitey Birdwell]: It didn't cripple me.

09:54.657 --> 09:56.059
[Whitey Birdwell]: They just sent me to the hospital to

09:56.545 --> 10:21.878
[Whitey Birdwell]: infection right and to get the satin out that was there right right so they dug it out and popped it out and give me penicillin and i was all right after that and you understand that the fellow that you the soldier that you were trying to help he was sent off to england i guess yeah he was sent off to england and somewhere else but he survived his wound as far as you know but you never heard any more about him at all right

10:22.246 --> 10:24.768
[Tom Turbeville]: Well, he probably remembers the guy that jumped in the foxhole with him.

10:25.089 --> 10:27.411
[Tom Turbeville]: I'm sure if he's alive today, I'm sure he remembers that.

10:27.491 --> 10:29.132
[Whitey Birdwell]: They call me Tex, so I remember.

10:31.835 --> 10:35.198
[Tom Turbeville]: After the hospital now, you were sent back to work.

10:35.218 --> 10:37.060
[Tom Turbeville]: You were in the hospital for nine to 10 days.

10:37.080 --> 10:42.285
[Tom Turbeville]: And talk about after you were in the hospital, you wanted to go back to the front lines.

10:42.365 --> 10:43.686
[Whitey Birdwell]: I did go back to the front lines.

10:43.706 --> 10:45.608
[Whitey Birdwell]: The safest place there was the front lines.

10:45.808 --> 10:46.268
[Tom Turbeville]: Exactly.

10:46.589 --> 10:49.131
[Whitey Birdwell]: So I went back and they were in Cologne.

10:50.073 --> 10:58.162
[Whitey Birdwell]: And that's where I was wounded on the Cologne Plains, and they were in Cologne waiting for the bridge to be built across the river to jump off again.

10:59.303 --> 11:03.848
[Whitey Birdwell]: So I went back and got the old tank and drove the first one across the Rhine River.

11:04.248 --> 11:04.849
[Tom Turbeville]: Talk about that.

11:05.109 --> 11:07.051
[Tom Turbeville]: That's quite significant, I think.

11:07.071 --> 11:08.373
[Tom Turbeville]: It was the first tank to drive.

11:08.393 --> 11:10.816
[Tom Turbeville]: It was over a pontoon bridge, right?

11:10.836 --> 11:11.997
[Tom Turbeville]: Over the Rhine River.

11:12.037 --> 11:15.861
[Whitey Birdwell]: Well, those pontoons were huge.

11:17.630 --> 11:19.112
[Whitey Birdwell]: My brother-in-law was there.

11:19.212 --> 11:22.715
[Whitey Birdwell]: I happened to get a glimpse of him, but I didn't get to talk to him because he was too busy.

11:22.735 --> 11:24.797
[Whitey Birdwell]: They just come and put up the wigs and took off.

11:25.818 --> 11:31.544
[Whitey Birdwell]: They were huge pontoons, and they tied them off on each side of that river because it was real swift.

11:32.325 --> 11:39.012
[Whitey Birdwell]: And then they tied them together with steel with pins in them.

11:39.172 --> 11:42.175
[Whitey Birdwell]: Then they laid the track across them where it would work.

11:42.575 --> 11:46.219
[Whitey Birdwell]: And when I looked at that thing, I said, well, I don't know.

11:46.418 --> 11:48.700
[Whitey Birdwell]: I'm going to leave my hatch off in case I go down.

11:48.720 --> 11:50.422
[Whitey Birdwell]: I can get out of this tank.

11:50.783 --> 11:51.003
[Tom Turbeville]: Right.

11:51.503 --> 11:52.945
[Whitey Birdwell]: But they were good.

11:52.985 --> 11:54.927
[Whitey Birdwell]: The Army supplied them real good.

11:54.947 --> 11:57.670
[Whitey Birdwell]: And so it would just go down and up, down and up.

11:58.391 --> 12:03.737
[Whitey Birdwell]: So we had to take our time going across them and not really rush, but just go with the flow.

12:03.757 --> 12:04.578
[Tom Turbeville]: Right.

12:04.598 --> 12:07.641
[Whitey Birdwell]: And so we all, trucks and all, made it across real good.

12:08.041 --> 12:08.282
[Tom Turbeville]: Right.

12:09.062 --> 12:12.426
[Tom Turbeville]: It was Whitey Birdwell's unit, as a matter of fact, that

12:12.929 --> 12:17.554
[Tom Turbeville]: As we read, it fired one of the first shells into Germany of the war.

12:17.995 --> 12:24.202
[Tom Turbeville]: And the 110-mile march, now you... We went back for... You went with those people, right?

12:24.222 --> 12:24.843
[Whitey Birdwell]: We went back.

12:25.564 --> 12:28.948
[Whitey Birdwell]: It was our time to go back for arrest and maintenance on their tanks.

12:28.968 --> 12:29.148
[Tom Turbeville]: Right.

12:29.529 --> 12:39.020
[Whitey Birdwell]: And we went back a half a day when they told us we had to jump off because the 104th Infantry Division had the Germans to give way and they followed them up.

12:39.040 --> 12:39.240
[Tom Turbeville]: Right.

12:39.625 --> 12:46.111
[Whitey Birdwell]: And they said, well, we got 110 miles to go before nightfall to catch them.

12:46.131 --> 12:52.557
[Whitey Birdwell]: So we made it up to within about, I guess about 15 miles of the town.

12:52.978 --> 12:59.904
[Whitey Birdwell]: And when the Germans shot the third tank driver's head off with a bazooka.

13:01.085 --> 13:02.787
[Whitey Birdwell]: And so that kind of disrupted the march.

13:02.807 --> 13:09.193
[Whitey Birdwell]: But they just got together and decided, well, we got to have somebody in town to let the Germans know that we arrived.

13:10.253 --> 13:13.056
[Whitey Birdwell]: And the diesel tank didn't have any exhaust flash from it.

13:13.076 --> 13:20.683
[Whitey Birdwell]: Where the raider tanks did, they burnt 90 octane gas and it was a huge flame coming out of the exhaust light.

13:20.703 --> 13:26.689
[Whitey Birdwell]: So then I did the night duty anyway because they couldn't pick me up other than sound.

13:26.709 --> 13:33.676
[Whitey Birdwell]: So I followed the tank sergeant into town with a luminous button on his belt.

13:33.696 --> 13:35.738
[Whitey Birdwell]: And I just had to stay so close to him.

13:36.477 --> 13:44.952
[Whitey Birdwell]: And we got into that town and I couldn't, I don't know how much whether I could have went, but I don't think very far because we were 110 miles on a tank of diesel is a long way.

13:44.972 --> 13:45.253
[Tom Turbeville]: Right.

13:45.413 --> 13:46.936
[Tom Turbeville]: And you were pretty much out of ammunition, right?

13:46.956 --> 13:49.941
[Whitey Birdwell]: Pretty well out of ammunition and all that stuff.

13:49.961 --> 13:53.227
[Whitey Birdwell]: We couldn't have fought a very good battle with what we had left.

13:53.247 --> 13:53.508
[Tom Turbeville]: Right.

13:53.988 --> 13:57.515
[Whitey Birdwell]: But anyway, the German heard us come in and they started moving out.

13:57.535 --> 13:57.675
[Tom Turbeville]: Mm-hmm.

13:58.448 --> 14:00.170
[Tom Turbeville]: They didn't know you were out of ammunition.

14:00.190 --> 14:00.510
[Tom Turbeville]: No, they didn't.

14:00.530 --> 14:01.211
[Tom Turbeville]: They just knew you were there.

14:01.371 --> 14:02.353
[Whitey Birdwell]: And I wasn't going to tell them.

14:02.373 --> 14:03.254
[Tom Turbeville]: You weren't going to tell them.

14:04.175 --> 14:05.296
[Tom Turbeville]: So your job sort of switched.

14:05.316 --> 14:07.138
[Tom Turbeville]: Your job was to support the infantry.

14:07.539 --> 14:10.462
[Whitey Birdwell]: Well, that was our main job all the way through, was to support the infantry.

14:10.482 --> 14:10.883
[Tom Turbeville]: That's right.

14:11.343 --> 14:13.866
[Tom Turbeville]: And in this strategy, they were taking care of you, too.

14:13.886 --> 14:14.267
[Tom Turbeville]: That's right.

14:14.307 --> 14:14.767
[Tom Turbeville]: They did.

14:15.729 --> 14:15.989
[Whitey Birdwell]: Yeah.

14:16.269 --> 14:18.312
[Whitey Birdwell]: Did a good job, too.

14:18.332 --> 14:21.796
[Whitey Birdwell]: The 104th said, bragged that they never lost a tank, and they didn't.

14:22.036 --> 14:22.317
[Tom Turbeville]: Right.

14:22.817 --> 14:23.818
[Whitey Birdwell]: And they were right there with us.

14:23.898 --> 14:25.801
[Tom Turbeville]: And you're glad, because you're one of the tanks they didn't lose.

14:26.001 --> 14:27.763
[Whitey Birdwell]: I was one of the tanks.

14:28.148 --> 14:46.268
[Tom Turbeville]: Talk about how I've always been fascinated to ask people, you know, as a 22, 23-year-old kid from Henderson, Texas, how did you feel having made the transition from being just a young Texas kid into warfare?

14:46.768 --> 14:51.273
[Tom Turbeville]: I mean, you had to rely and trust on your training an awful lot, right?

14:51.513 --> 14:52.154
[Tom Turbeville]: Were you scared?

14:54.276 --> 14:56.359
[Whitey Birdwell]: To start with, I was scared to death.

14:56.379 --> 14:57.700
[Tom Turbeville]: Yes, sir.

14:58.186 --> 15:01.070
[Whitey Birdwell]: you automatically do what they train you to do regardless.

15:01.271 --> 15:02.453
[Whitey Birdwell]: Something has to kick in.

15:03.174 --> 15:05.017
[Whitey Birdwell]: So the training did.

15:05.037 --> 15:09.864
[Whitey Birdwell]: But I wasn't so fearful after I kind of got used to what was going on.

15:10.225 --> 15:10.505
[Tom Turbeville]: Right.

15:10.565 --> 15:14.311
[Whitey Birdwell]: Because I was busy taking care of ourselves, you know, in the battle and whatever.

15:15.172 --> 15:21.462
[Whitey Birdwell]: And listening to the orders that, of course, your captain always tried to take care of you anyway.

15:22.484 --> 15:24.747
[Whitey Birdwell]: But he was back observing what was going on.

15:25.809 --> 15:26.590
[Whitey Birdwell]: So when...

15:27.143 --> 15:33.609
[Whitey Birdwell]: you don't realize when you're in basic training, how much the safety of it kicks in until you're there.

15:33.930 --> 15:34.170
[Tom Turbeville]: Right.

15:34.610 --> 15:41.557
[Whitey Birdwell]: But it just automatically kicks in and you do the thing that you need to do to preserve yourself.

15:41.577 --> 15:53.589
[Tom Turbeville]: You were in Europe for the better part, almost the entire part of the year of 1944, which is, you know, arguably the most significant year of the war as far as the European theater is concerned.

15:54.490 --> 15:57.032
[Tom Turbeville]: You were during this, you were, you were,

15:57.282 --> 16:01.748
[Tom Turbeville]: in this move through Germany when D-Day occurred in June of 1944.

16:02.068 --> 16:03.169
[Tom Turbeville]: You were there.

16:03.970 --> 16:15.985
[Tom Turbeville]: Were you all getting any news or anything like that, that there was an invasion in Normandy, that the decision had been made to make the final push and to defeat Hitler by making this final push?

16:16.025 --> 16:20.171
[Tom Turbeville]: Were you all aware of sort of what was happening in the war rooms?

16:20.231 --> 16:22.133
[Whitey Birdwell]: Well, we knew when Hitler killed himself.

16:22.413 --> 16:23.455
[Tom Turbeville]: Right.

16:23.475 --> 16:26.158
[Whitey Birdwell]: And we were more or less brought up through

16:26.948 --> 16:32.916
[Whitey Birdwell]: Not by news, but by word of mouth from here to there and the little paper that they gave us.

16:32.936 --> 16:33.197
[Tom Turbeville]: Right.

16:33.637 --> 16:37.102
[Whitey Birdwell]: And so we kind of kept up on that all the way through.

16:37.582 --> 16:38.243
[Tom Turbeville]: Right.

16:38.263 --> 16:46.495
[Whitey Birdwell]: And we knew where the different units were because they were reported in the Stars and Tripes.

16:46.515 --> 16:47.236
[Tom Turbeville]: Exactly.

16:47.256 --> 16:50.380
[Whitey Birdwell]: To let us know that we did have company over there.

16:50.620 --> 16:50.881
[Tom Turbeville]: Right.

16:51.261 --> 16:51.542
[Whitey Birdwell]: Yeah.

16:51.562 --> 16:54.846
[Whitey Birdwell]: And so that gave us assurance and helped us out a whole lot.

16:55.282 --> 16:59.148
[Tom Turbeville]: Winter of 1944-45, that was in the Battle of the Bulge.

16:59.328 --> 17:04.155
[Tom Turbeville]: And whenever I talk to anybody who served in the Battle of the Bulge, they talk about the weather.

17:04.435 --> 17:05.397
[Tom Turbeville]: They talk about the cold.

17:06.458 --> 17:10.144
[Tom Turbeville]: How do you describe it?

17:10.164 --> 17:16.152
[Whitey Birdwell]: Well, if he was at the North Pole, you would know it was terrific, I'll tell you that.

17:16.172 --> 17:18.395
[Whitey Birdwell]: We had our tanks hit in the snow.

17:18.796 --> 17:19.197
[Tom Turbeville]: Is that right?

17:19.537 --> 17:20.158
[Whitey Birdwell]: Yeah.

17:22.163 --> 17:31.214
[Whitey Birdwell]: Well, I don't know other than to say that we just had six foot of snow, and you couldn't touch the tank with a bare hand.

17:31.415 --> 17:32.676
[Whitey Birdwell]: You had to stick to it.

17:32.957 --> 17:34.118
[Tom Turbeville]: Right.

17:34.138 --> 17:36.862
[Whitey Birdwell]: And I don't know how we made out, but we did.

17:36.882 --> 17:37.563
[Whitey Birdwell]: We lived through it.

17:37.803 --> 17:41.007
[Whitey Birdwell]: We didn't have any casualties there.

17:42.589 --> 17:51.360
[Whitey Birdwell]: We knocked out one German tank that had come through, lumbered through, and the first guy that was a tank sergeant

17:51.712 --> 18:15.576
[Whitey Birdwell]: called him porky he said oh we're not going to do this we're going to wait until he gets further down the line and we'll have more support right but when he come down there we put a white process on him and they come out like black wars go for nests so we didn't have anything any trouble with him just knocked the tank out it burned okay got three images i want to show you uh whitey Birdwell

18:15.758 --> 18:20.448
[Tom Turbeville]: This is your patch, which you have actually on the hat that you're wearing today, too.

18:20.849 --> 18:24.758
[Tom Turbeville]: This is a close-up of it, of the 3rd Armored Division spearhead.

18:24.798 --> 18:26.221
[Tom Turbeville]: That's the insignia.

18:26.241 --> 18:29.408
[Tom Turbeville]: This is something that I came across that I found.

18:29.448 --> 18:30.530
[Tom Turbeville]: It's a sketch, actually.

18:31.051 --> 18:34.138
[Tom Turbeville]: And that is Major General Rose in the top of that tank.

18:34.709 --> 18:45.299
[Tom Turbeville]: And he was actually, this is a depiction of the time that through a misunderstanding that he was actually killed at this time.

18:45.319 --> 18:49.804
[Tom Turbeville]: And this was a depiction actually of the moments just prior to his murder.

18:50.705 --> 18:54.428
[Tom Turbeville]: And you speak of Major General Rose.

18:54.448 --> 19:00.514
[Tom Turbeville]: And that's sort of a look of what the kind of tank that you had

19:01.456 --> 19:02.978
[Tom Turbeville]: And that you were driving.

19:02.998 --> 19:05.160
[Tom Turbeville]: And you say not many generals rode in tanks, right?

19:05.440 --> 19:05.961
[Whitey Birdwell]: That's right.

19:06.261 --> 19:06.962
[Whitey Birdwell]: They didn't.

19:07.342 --> 19:09.184
[Whitey Birdwell]: Well, there wasn't many generals on the line.

19:09.284 --> 19:10.205
[Tom Turbeville]: Exactly.

19:10.225 --> 19:18.995
[Whitey Birdwell]: Because they were back in the direction, in directing the Army and keeping up with casualties and all this stuff.

19:19.875 --> 19:25.101
[Whitey Birdwell]: And they gave, of course, they gave the orders, the marching orders and this kind of thing.

19:26.195 --> 19:31.864
[Whitey Birdwell]: They had a tremendous job to do to take care of everything other than just being on line.

19:32.746 --> 19:35.771
[Tom Turbeville]: There's another sketch in the back end of a Sherman tank.

19:35.851 --> 19:36.632
[Tom Turbeville]: Yeah.

19:36.652 --> 19:42.602
[Tom Turbeville]: Of the type of tank that Whitey Birdwell piloted.

19:44.265 --> 19:48.712
[Tom Turbeville]: And some of the terrain was quite interesting, I guess, right?

19:49.413 --> 19:50.295
[Tom Turbeville]: Getting stuck in the mud.

19:50.936 --> 19:52.759
[Whitey Birdwell]: Well, we were...

19:54.443 --> 20:22.307
[Whitey Birdwell]: driving and we had had some anti-aircraft guns up on the hill and we wanted to dodge those so we got down low into going up by a valley and of course i got in the quicksand and i went down right so i had to stay there that night and suffer that anti-air attack fire for two or three hours and some of the infantry got hurt right we would jump down deep enough that the water was coming in our tanks

20:22.861 --> 20:28.688
[Tom Turbeville]: Tell me the story that you were telling me before we started today, the story that you forgot to tell me the other day, that you were talking about.

20:28.708 --> 20:32.212
[Whitey Birdwell]: Oh, we were, after we carried our infantry up to the Earth River, where we met the Russians.

20:32.953 --> 20:33.073
[Whitey Birdwell]: Right.

20:33.093 --> 20:35.736
[Whitey Birdwell]: We went back to a little town called Sugar Town.

20:36.377 --> 20:41.403
[Whitey Birdwell]: It was Sukerstop, and that's what they called their villages, were Stots.

20:41.423 --> 20:51.315
[Whitey Birdwell]: And so we carried them up there, and we went back, of course, in the holding position, and we thought everything was over with and clear back there, but one morning,

20:52.105 --> 20:57.110
[Whitey Birdwell]: I think about three days after we carried our infantry up, the Germans come in on us.

20:57.130 --> 21:05.658
[Whitey Birdwell]: And I was in the tank at the time, but the captain's driver come running up and said, Germans is in town.

21:05.718 --> 21:12.384
[Whitey Birdwell]: So I said, well, go wake the guys up back on the door and holler help or something and just get them out here.

21:12.424 --> 21:15.987
[Whitey Birdwell]: And I said, I'll take my rifle and play infantry.

21:16.007 --> 21:17.869
[Whitey Birdwell]: The graveyard was right across the street.

21:17.909 --> 21:21.252
[Whitey Birdwell]: And so I said, you can drive my tank and I'll be out there.

21:21.923 --> 21:23.385
[Whitey Birdwell]: try to keep them off of you.

21:24.547 --> 21:26.890
[Whitey Birdwell]: So I got out there and fired one shot in my rifle.

21:26.930 --> 21:30.595
[Whitey Birdwell]: I was sitting out there at the graveyard and they're kicking up dirt around me.

21:30.615 --> 21:32.959
[Whitey Birdwell]: But anyway, it turned out real good.

21:34.381 --> 21:35.642
[Tom Turbeville]: Yeah, because you're here talking to them.

21:35.662 --> 21:37.545
[Whitey Birdwell]: I'm here talking to them.

21:37.565 --> 21:41.771
[Whitey Birdwell]: They came by and I didn't know where the Germans were located.

21:41.811 --> 21:43.453
[Whitey Birdwell]: I knew that they were around that graveyard.

21:44.515 --> 21:49.602
[Whitey Birdwell]: So when they, of course, they didn't come through the graveyard with my tank and I didn't go across the fence.

21:50.459 --> 21:53.924
[Whitey Birdwell]: But anyway, they got down a ways, and they decided, well, we better come back.

21:53.964 --> 21:59.592
[Whitey Birdwell]: And so they come back firing the machine gun over me, and I got over the fence and followed the tank out.

21:59.612 --> 22:00.934
[Whitey Birdwell]: Everything turned out real good.

22:01.195 --> 22:05.941
[Whitey Birdwell]: It lasted about three or four hours, and we got them all cleaned out.

22:05.961 --> 22:11.910
[Tom Turbeville]: When the war in Europe ended, you came back into holding patterns, came back to a rest camp.

22:12.413 --> 22:14.897
[Tom Turbeville]: and sort of talk about what you did.

22:15.157 --> 22:23.892
[Tom Turbeville]: A lot of the soldiers and the military people were told immediately, well, we're going to put you on boats and we're going to go over to Japan because we're going to fight a ground war there.

22:24.192 --> 22:26.055
[Tom Turbeville]: But that was not part of your mission.

22:26.075 --> 22:28.119
[Tom Turbeville]: Talk about what your mission was.

22:28.139 --> 22:32.025
[Whitey Birdwell]: Our mission was just to set up military government to clean the town, to pick up the

22:32.275 --> 22:38.685
[Whitey Birdwell]: arms and ammunition that were left over and kind of established a pattern of government for them.

22:38.725 --> 22:49.041
[Whitey Birdwell]: And so we came back from up there to an SS rest camp by, I don't know where it was really.

22:51.445 --> 22:52.967
[Whitey Birdwell]: But anyway, it was a nice log.

22:53.437 --> 22:58.066
[Whitey Birdwell]: encampment there, and we stayed there three days and nights and got everything ready.

22:58.086 --> 23:05.680
[Whitey Birdwell]: And we trolled back to Moorfield and by Frankfurt on the Rhine and stayed there several weeks till we got the town cleaned up.

23:07.183 --> 23:11.732
[Whitey Birdwell]: And then the military government took over and when they'd take over, we'd move out to another town

23:11.712 --> 23:15.858
[Whitey Birdwell]: cleaned it up and let the military come in.

23:15.978 --> 23:20.704
[Whitey Birdwell]: We wound up, the last place we were at was down in Swabish Hall down in southern Germany.

23:22.066 --> 23:33.141
[Whitey Birdwell]: And that's where we broke up and they put us on the cattle cars, carried us up to the North Sea and put us on the boat and brought us home after they made up a load.

23:33.621 --> 23:37.386
[Tom Turbeville]: January 12, 1945, so you were overseas just over a year.

23:38.107 --> 23:40.150
[Tom Turbeville]: And you said you went

23:40.383 --> 23:47.353
[Tom Turbeville]: Probably in a year's time, you probably traveled about as far as anybody possibly could in one year's time.

23:47.473 --> 23:52.600
[Whitey Birdwell]: Well, I didn't go through, of course, I was lucky I didn't go through North Africa or I didn't come through Italy.

23:52.620 --> 23:53.041
[Tom Turbeville]: Right.

23:53.061 --> 23:56.005
[Whitey Birdwell]: But I went all the way through France, Belgium, and Germany.

23:56.025 --> 23:57.447
[Tom Turbeville]: Exactly.

23:57.467 --> 23:58.188
[Tom Turbeville]: And you came home.

23:59.049 --> 24:01.092
[Tom Turbeville]: They tried to leave you, right?

24:01.342 --> 24:09.775
[Tom Turbeville]: when you were coming home, they told you they were going to... Well, we got back into... You outsmarted them, yeah.

24:09.795 --> 24:11.017
[Whitey Birdwell]: We went down to Pittsburgh.

24:12.199 --> 24:18.489
[Whitey Birdwell]: We tried to see everything we could see while we was on that trip, but we didn't figure that we would ever have an opportunity to go back.

24:19.470 --> 24:21.173
[Whitey Birdwell]: So we went down to Pittsburgh, and...

24:21.929 --> 24:27.414
[Whitey Birdwell]: Got back into camp, but they'd already shipped out, so we just grabbed our bags and got on the train that was coming to Texas.

24:28.335 --> 24:30.237
[Whitey Birdwell]: It was the only time I could talk back to a colonel.

24:31.738 --> 24:34.020
[Tom Turbeville]: But you ended up getting back before the rest of them, right?

24:34.561 --> 24:35.161
[Whitey Birdwell]: I sure did.

24:35.301 --> 24:38.184
[Whitey Birdwell]: Got my discharge before the rest of the Texas boys did.

24:38.204 --> 24:40.967
[Tom Turbeville]: Yeah, they made room in the aisles for you to get home.

24:40.987 --> 24:42.628
[Tom Turbeville]: You came home, you tried to get working.

24:43.329 --> 24:47.353
[Tom Turbeville]: I looked this up because you made reference to it that you joined the 5220 Club.

24:47.453 --> 24:48.814
[Tom Turbeville]: Yeah.

24:49.300 --> 25:00.453
[Tom Turbeville]: I found out what that was, and it says, at the time, veterans were eligible to collect unemployment benefits for a period of one year.

25:00.473 --> 25:04.318
[Tom Turbeville]: The amount paid was $20 a week for 52 weeks, hence the 5220 Club.

25:04.919 --> 25:12.188
[Tom Turbeville]: At that time, $20 a week was a fairish amount of money, and that would roughly equate to about $400 a week in today's dollars.

25:12.328 --> 25:15.932
[Tom Turbeville]: That would be about pay for that, but it was rough finding work.

25:16.300 --> 25:17.202
[Tom Turbeville]: There wasn't any.

25:17.282 --> 25:18.584
[Tom Turbeville]: Coming back, there wasn't any.

25:18.604 --> 25:19.245
[Tom Turbeville]: Wasn't any work.

25:19.526 --> 25:20.948
[Tom Turbeville]: So you were a 5220 guy.

25:21.048 --> 25:21.629
[Tom Turbeville]: Right.

25:21.649 --> 25:24.775
[Tom Turbeville]: But eventually you did work and talk to sort of about what your career.

25:24.795 --> 25:27.360
[Tom Turbeville]: I know you were in trucking, refinery business.

25:27.580 --> 25:33.490
[Whitey Birdwell]: Well, I started out driving a truck and that was a low paying job, but it was better than the farm hand.

25:34.212 --> 25:34.612
[Whitey Birdwell]: Right.

25:34.632 --> 25:39.842
[Whitey Birdwell]: And so I just went from there to construction work.

25:39.862 --> 25:40.603
[Whitey Birdwell]: And when they

25:43.300 --> 25:52.233
[Whitey Birdwell]: Time began to change and of course the refineries were trying to build themselves up into repair.

25:53.235 --> 25:59.063
[Whitey Birdwell]: Fort Beacon Davis had a job going into carbide and so I took off down to Texas City and went to work at Fort Beacon Davis.

25:59.944 --> 26:05.212
[Whitey Birdwell]: And I stayed down there for a number of years and worked construction work.

26:05.793 --> 26:10.540
[Whitey Birdwell]: And I worked there in Freeport.

26:11.195 --> 26:16.079
[Whitey Birdwell]: Galveston, Houston, then went to Chicago and worked there.

26:16.119 --> 26:18.722
[Whitey Birdwell]: And I worked Fort Arthur and wherever the work was.

26:18.942 --> 26:20.744
[Tom Turbeville]: And whose house did you live in in Chicago?

26:21.464 --> 26:22.345
[Tom Turbeville]: Paul Harvey's house.

26:22.405 --> 26:23.246
[Tom Turbeville]: Paul Harvey's house.

26:23.326 --> 26:24.867
[Tom Turbeville]: He actually owned the house that you leased, right?

26:24.887 --> 26:25.828
[Tom Turbeville]: He owned the house that I leased.

26:25.848 --> 26:27.710
[Tom Turbeville]: So he was your landlord, was Paul Harvey.

26:27.730 --> 26:29.632
[Whitey Birdwell]: He was in California at the time.

26:29.652 --> 26:30.853
[Tom Turbeville]: And that's the rest of the story there.

26:32.434 --> 26:32.534
[Tom Turbeville]: Yeah.

26:32.554 --> 26:33.976
[Tom Turbeville]: He was in California at the time.

26:33.996 --> 26:34.456
[Tom Turbeville]: That's right.

26:35.537 --> 26:39.801
[Tom Turbeville]: You even talked about one time you actually lost a job indirectly because of Watergate.

26:40.270 --> 26:45.615
[Whitey Birdwell]: Well, I was in Phoenix working for Martin Construction.

26:45.856 --> 26:52.603
[Whitey Birdwell]: And the Martin... It was part of the Richard Nixon story.

26:52.623 --> 27:02.352
[Whitey Birdwell]: Well, one from California, I think it was a representative of some kind of senator, and he was mixed up in the Watergate, but he had previously bought in with the Martians of Phoenix.

27:03.574 --> 27:05.856
[Whitey Birdwell]: And so when this Watergate broke, or...

27:06.494 --> 27:08.137
[Whitey Birdwell]: We went out to job that morning.

27:08.157 --> 27:09.800
[Whitey Birdwell]: They said, clean up boys, we're through.

27:09.820 --> 27:11.563
[Whitey Birdwell]: We're going to be out of here in eight hours.

27:12.064 --> 27:13.166
[Tom Turbeville]: That's a tough way to lose a job.

27:13.547 --> 27:15.791
[Tom Turbeville]: We're just about out of time, Whitey, and I want to thank you.

27:15.911 --> 27:27.632
[Tom Turbeville]: Your first wife, Edith, died of cancer, and you all had lost a child, but you had six children, and you married Patsy in 1965, and she had five children, and together 11.

27:28.394 --> 27:28.654
[Tom Turbeville]: Yes.

27:29.326 --> 27:30.969
[Tom Turbeville]: And thank you for being with us.

27:31.109 --> 27:31.770
[Tom Turbeville]: We appreciate it.

27:31.790 --> 27:32.852
[Whitey Birdwell]: And thank you for your service.

27:33.012 --> 27:35.156
[Whitey Birdwell]: I lived in a wonderful world of women.

27:36.418 --> 27:36.939
[Tom Turbeville]: Lucky you.

27:37.620 --> 27:40.806
[Tom Turbeville]: Whitey Birdwell and his wife Patsy were married in 1965.

27:41.467 --> 27:45.594
[Tom Turbeville]: And between them, 11 children, 18 grandkids, and 31 great-grandkids.

27:45.995 --> 27:48.980
[Tom Turbeville]: And all can be justly proud of Whitey's service to our country.

27:49.000 --> 27:51.464
[Tom Turbeville]: We salute him as we do all veterans.

27:51.484 --> 27:52.345
[Tom Turbeville]: I'm Tom Turbeville.

27:52.386 --> 27:55.030
[Tom Turbeville]: Join us next time on Veterans of the Valley.
