00:09.260 --> 00:13.220
Coming up next is the science fiction radio show, so stay with us.

00:28.960 --> 00:34.320
This is the science fiction radio show, a commentary on science fiction and fantasy.

00:36.880 --> 00:38.660
And here are your hosts.

00:42.680 --> 00:44.840
This is Daryl Lane and David Cruz.

00:45.280 --> 00:48.840
Poole Anderson is one of a small group of science fiction authors who have written future histories.

00:49.300 --> 00:53.460
A future history is a group of stories or novels written along a consistent timeline

00:53.460 --> 00:54.140
in the future.

00:54.680 --> 00:58.900
Characters may or may not recur, but the intention is to speculate on the evolution

00:58.900 --> 01:01.240
of human society beyond the present day.

01:01.620 --> 01:03.700
Anderson actually has written two future histories.

01:03.700 --> 01:07.300
The first is not as best known, and it consists of only a dozen or so stories.

01:07.780 --> 01:10.160
Anderson began it in the late 1940s.

01:10.280 --> 01:21.460
But I started out originally rather early in my career and more or less inspired by

01:21.460 --> 01:36.440
Heinlein's future history and constructed one of my own with charts and background material

01:36.440 --> 01:38.220
and so on, like his.

01:38.220 --> 01:47.080
Of course mine was in mind the events were different, but basically I wanted to do a

01:47.080 --> 02:01.320
similar job that is fictionally tell about the story of mankind from almost the present

02:01.320 --> 02:09.700
day up at least until the early year of expansion among the stars.

02:10.900 --> 02:16.580
This wasn't going to be the only thing I did by any means, although I would write other

02:16.580 --> 02:18.180
things that were not in the series.

02:20.320 --> 02:26.100
But from time to time I'd add something to it, and I did over the years.

02:33.140 --> 02:38.180
Some of the stories in this future history are Wolf, Quixote in the Windmill, Cold Victory,

02:38.760 --> 02:40.140
and The Snows of Ganymede.

02:40.580 --> 02:44.980
The earliest stories in the series describe World War 3, which Anderson had said in 1958,

02:45.480 --> 02:47.200
a war that destroys modern civilization.

02:47.740 --> 02:50.480
But out of the war decades later rose a new civilization.

02:50.980 --> 02:55.920
It was a repressive one dominated by the Psycho-Technic Institute, an organization which

02:55.920 --> 03:00.360
strictly plans and controls human progress through psychological manipulation.

03:00.920 --> 03:05.160
Anderson carefully traces out the social, political, and technological events which

03:05.160 --> 03:06.100
shape the new society.

03:06.500 --> 03:10.700
He describes the colonization of Venus and Mars, for instance, the development of robotics

03:10.700 --> 03:14.340
and artificial regeneration, and the struggle toward a true world government.

03:15.040 --> 03:19.340
In one story, The Troublemakers, he sends a space ark off to Alpha Centauri in a voyage that will

03:19.340 --> 03:20.800
take 123 years.

03:21.200 --> 03:26.180
But overall things don't go smoothly. Anderson envisions society undergoing many upheavals.

03:26.600 --> 03:30.020
In Quixote in the Windmill, for instance, there are violent anti-robot riots.

03:30.360 --> 03:34.620
And in Cold Victory, a humanist revolution occurs which overthrows the Psycho-Technic Institute.

03:34.980 --> 03:38.860
But some of the institute's people escape to Ganymede, the largest of Jupiter's moons,

03:39.000 --> 03:40.060
where they continue fighting.

03:40.800 --> 03:44.620
It isn't until the story break, the last one in this particular future history,

03:44.800 --> 03:46.380
that the institute is totally wiped out.

03:47.060 --> 03:51.660
At this point, around the 23rd century, the human race is ready to attempt interstellar colonization.

03:52.080 --> 03:54.320
Anderson leaves it there at the beginning of a new era.

03:54.620 --> 03:56.700
He explains why he added no more to it.

03:57.480 --> 04:00.440
But gradually, for a number of reasons,

04:02.240 --> 04:08.600
got less and less interested in continuing and started phasing it out, doing less and less of it.

04:09.240 --> 04:18.020
One reason for being less interested was that, as for the early part of it, reality was catching up with me.

04:18.820 --> 04:28.900
Not only were public or political events not working out on my timetable,

04:29.620 --> 04:37.780
for example, World War III did not come off on schedule, but also it turned out I had failed

04:37.780 --> 04:42.420
to foresee a number of scientific and technological developments.

04:43.600 --> 04:46.580
Anderson's second future history is much larger and better known.

04:46.580 --> 04:49.560
It includes some of the most memorable characters he's created,

04:50.040 --> 04:51.880
like Nicholas von Rine and Dominic Flandry.

04:52.200 --> 04:54.620
We'll talk with Anderson about that series next time.

05:01.800 --> 05:06.040
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show, a production of the Permian Basin

05:06.040 --> 05:10.600
Science Fiction Association produced in conjunction with Odessa College in Odessa, Texas.

05:52.160 --> 05:56.220
Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

06:12.080 --> 06:17.440
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and fantasy.

06:20.140 --> 06:21.820
And here are your hosts.

06:26.380 --> 06:28.540
This is David Cruz and Daryl Lane.

06:29.040 --> 06:32.500
Poole Anderson has written one of the most ambitious and extensive future histories

06:32.500 --> 06:33.420
in science fiction.

06:33.780 --> 06:36.460
It's usually called the Future History of the Polysoteknic League,

06:36.780 --> 06:38.880
although a better term might be the League and Empire series.

06:39.260 --> 06:41.500
We asked Anderson how the future history got its start.

06:42.580 --> 06:47.140
Now that has a history much more like that of Tuipsy. It just grew.

06:50.820 --> 06:57.680
I've written a few stories about Nicholas von Rine and a few stories about Dominic Flandry,

06:57.780 --> 07:00.380
who lived in completely different miliaries, of course.

07:01.660 --> 07:10.460
And then one day on an impulse, I thought, well, gosh, they could be on the same timeline,

07:10.720 --> 07:13.180
one living about 500 years after the other.

07:14.160 --> 07:19.140
And through an invention of that in one of the once one of the Flandry stories,

07:21.300 --> 07:28.140
and then started fitting in other stories wherever it was convenient.

07:28.700 --> 07:36.240
You see, the thing with the future history is that although each story should, of course,

07:37.440 --> 07:43.160
be readable independently of any others and comprehensible and so on,

07:43.960 --> 07:51.280
nevertheless, if you have a reader who remembers a number of them, the cross connections will

07:51.280 --> 07:55.400
add an extra dimension and thereby a hope that's in his enjoyment.

07:58.420 --> 08:07.200
So I started doing it that way. And after a while realized I had a rather large beast by

08:07.200 --> 08:16.260
the tail. If I was going to stay consistent at all, then I had to keep careful notes.

08:17.080 --> 08:21.800
And I had to develop a systematic scheme and so on.

08:22.840 --> 08:28.140
And that's over the years one thing led to another until it all became

08:29.160 --> 08:39.760
rather elaborate. By now it includes, no, I think something like 40 separate items of which

08:41.200 --> 08:47.380
probably at least a third or so are full dressed novels.

08:48.580 --> 08:52.600
The first story Nicholas Von Ryn turned up in was the novel The Man Who Counts,

08:52.780 --> 08:58.100
which was also issued as the War of the Wingman. Von Ryn is a nonheroic type. He's a fat, loud

08:58.100 --> 09:03.660
mouthed, cursing schemer who favors good food, drink and creature comforts. But using his wits,

09:03.820 --> 09:08.960
he usually conquers all of his foes, human or alien. He establishes the Polysottechnic League,

09:09.260 --> 09:13.440
a trading guild which carries earth culture throughout the stars. We asked Anderson if Von Ryn

09:13.440 --> 09:21.080
has been popular with readers. Oh yes, there are some readers who can't stand him but they

09:22.300 --> 09:31.620
don't ignore him either and as for the rest, he probably is the most popular character I've

09:31.620 --> 09:37.420
ever come up with. Then about 500 years along the timeline of his future history, Anderson

09:37.420 --> 09:42.180
introduces Dominic Flandry, an agent for the Tarran Empire. He turns up in books like Ensign

09:42.180 --> 09:48.300
Flandry, The Rebel Worlds, Earthman Go Home, and A Night of Ghosts and Shadows. The Flandry stories

09:48.300 --> 09:52.420
are set in the 31st century and involve the Tarran Empire's druggler with its powerful alien

09:52.420 --> 09:58.580
antagonist, the Merseans. Flandry is the opposite of Von Ryn. He smooths, sophisticated, suave,

09:58.940 --> 10:03.880
a man who can either fight or scheme with equal style and flair. He reminds a reader of James Bond.

10:04.320 --> 10:10.840
We asked Anderson if the relationship was intentional. Oh no, nor did I ask this before and

10:10.840 --> 10:15.640
as a matter of fact, the first Flandry story appeared something like 20 years before the first

10:15.640 --> 10:23.760
James Bond story did. If I was modeling on any other character at all, it would probably have

10:23.760 --> 10:29.240
had to be somebody like the sink. Anderson says he probably won't be adding any more to the future

10:29.240 --> 10:34.000
history of the Polysoteknic League and the Tarran Empire, but there's enough material there already

10:34.000 --> 10:39.120
to keep a science fiction reader busy for a long time. We'll have some more on Poole Anderson next time.

10:46.420 --> 10:51.300
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show, a production of the Permian Basin Science Fiction

10:51.300 --> 10:55.200
Association produced in conjunction with Odessa College in Odessa, Texas.

11:36.160 --> 11:40.080
Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

11:56.080 --> 12:01.480
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and fantasy.

12:04.180 --> 12:05.860
And here are your hosts.

12:10.200 --> 12:14.960
This is Daryl Lane and David Cruz. A number of science fiction authors employ the technique

12:14.960 --> 12:19.580
of worldbuilding in their stories. Poole Anderson is one of the best at worldbuilding. He explains the

12:19.580 --> 12:33.320
term. The term simply refers to the construction of an imaginary world as a setting for a story

12:33.980 --> 12:43.400
in considerable detail. Now, lots of people have done this. An obvious example, for example,

12:43.700 --> 12:54.660
would be J.R.R. Tolkien in The Lord of the Rings and Related Stories. He constructs an imaginary

12:54.660 --> 13:01.940
world in vast detail, complete down the fine points of the various languages spoken and so on.

13:02.800 --> 13:06.180
Anderson's first extensive attempt at worldbuilding was the Planet Diomedes,

13:06.400 --> 13:10.220
which was a setting for his novel The Man Who Counts. He meticulously constructs the

13:10.220 --> 13:15.200
planet in detail that allows winged intelligent beings. The atmosphere, for example, is very

13:15.200 --> 13:20.260
heavy, which is necessary to support a large flying creature. Anderson explains why he spends

13:20.260 --> 13:23.340
so much time constructing his planets in consistent and careful detail.

13:24.260 --> 13:33.340
After all, we really cannot reasonably expect that any other planet anywhere in the universe

13:33.340 --> 13:41.400
will be very much like Earth. We'll probably be lucky if we find a few where humans can live

13:41.400 --> 13:51.460
without artificial help. And you're certainly not going to have native humans around there

13:52.420 --> 14:00.780
or oak trees or rabbits or any other feature that we know here on Earth.

14:03.300 --> 14:09.560
That's just preposterous, to suppose, on the basis of everything we know about the evolution of life

14:09.560 --> 14:22.120
here on Earth. So, in that case, let's try to set up some of the features which are different.

14:23.880 --> 14:31.500
After all, one reason people read science fiction is precisely that they like to get away from the

14:31.500 --> 14:38.100
world around them once in a while and escape into something exotic. In my opinion,

14:40.120 --> 14:47.800
to the extent that this exotic thing can be made at the same time realistic and convincing,

14:48.760 --> 14:51.220
the reader is getting his money's worth.

14:57.740 --> 15:02.220
Almost any world constructed by Anderson in his science fiction stories is put together with

15:02.220 --> 15:06.800
attention given to basic scientific laws. Anderson, after all, was a physics student in

15:06.800 --> 15:12.020
college and knows his science. Other authors, Hal Clement and Larry Niven come to mind, practice

15:12.020 --> 15:16.700
careful world building too. In fact, Clement says his science fiction novel challenges its readers

15:16.700 --> 15:21.460
to find any scientific errors committed by the author. Clement calls this The Game. Anderson

15:21.460 --> 15:30.700
elaborates on it. The game consists in an author setting up a world or a situation or something

15:30.700 --> 15:35.400
the very best he can and writing a story about it.

15:37.240 --> 15:46.280
And then that's all he can do. He's made his move and that's it. And readers are free to

15:47.280 --> 15:55.140
thereafter to try to figure out from the story exactly what he had in mind and exactly where he

15:55.140 --> 16:04.220
may have gone wrong. So I've gotten some very interesting mail on technical points. And yes,

16:04.480 --> 16:12.540
sometimes they have indicated to me that I've goofed on this or that detail, but all right.

16:13.500 --> 16:18.360
Wondering from that, I don't mind. With Anderson and with other world builders,

16:18.840 --> 16:22.760
a reader gets a bonus to accompany an exciting narrative, interesting and accurate science.

16:23.480 --> 16:25.600
More with Poole Anderson in our next show.

16:32.760 --> 16:37.760
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show, a production of the Permian Basin Science Fiction

16:37.760 --> 16:41.700
Association produced in conjunction with Odessa College in Odessa, Texas.

17:21.880 --> 17:22.680
Coming up next,

17:22.680 --> 17:25.800
is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

17:41.900 --> 17:47.300
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and fantasy.

17:49.820 --> 17:51.700
And here are your hosts.

17:56.360 --> 18:02.120
This is David Cruz and Daryl Lane. Poole Anderson is noted both as a master world builder and as a

18:02.120 --> 18:07.080
creator of believable aliens. He matches aliens to their planets with meticulous and loving care

18:07.080 --> 18:12.060
and with great concern for scientific accuracy. One of the best examples of his talents in this area

18:12.060 --> 18:16.640
is the race of winged creatures included in his future history of the Polysotheknic League.

18:17.300 --> 18:20.060
Actually, he constructed two separate races of winged beings,

18:20.560 --> 18:24.940
the Diomedians from the Nicholas Von Ryn novel The Man Who Counts and the Ythrians of the planet

18:24.940 --> 18:30.140
Avalon. Anderson explains how he got interested in intelligent beings with the ability to fly.

18:30.860 --> 18:37.360
All the way back when, many years ago, I mean many years ago,

18:39.340 --> 18:46.840
it's about 40 by now, Elsprake the Camp had published an article on

18:48.040 --> 18:59.600
intelligent non-human beings. He used basic physical principles to demolish a number of notions,

18:59.760 --> 19:05.740
you know, like the idea of a giant insect and so on. It's just impossible. It would collapse

19:05.740 --> 19:11.000
under its own weight because it hasn't got the structure to support that weight, things like that.

19:12.400 --> 19:18.960
And one thing he doubted was that you could have an intelligent being which flies

19:22.300 --> 19:38.380
because the wing loading that a living flyer can absorb is or take

19:38.380 --> 19:44.820
is so small that there just wouldn't be room for a sizable brain.

19:46.220 --> 19:50.380
Anderson thought about the camp's arguments and at last came to at least a partial solution.

19:51.540 --> 19:55.700
Well, science fiction writers tend to take this sort of a thing as a challenge.

19:57.760 --> 20:01.120
And so when I wrote The Man Who Counts quite a while ago,

20:04.520 --> 20:11.120
I did have wing intelligent beings, but I designed a planet such that it had a very dense atmosphere

20:13.340 --> 20:16.500
which of course would make it easier to get about in the air.

20:18.820 --> 20:24.960
I also made them essentially six-limbed so that they could have not only wings but

20:24.960 --> 20:32.080
legs and hands. Well, after what I got to thinking that that had been a kind of a cop-out,

20:32.300 --> 20:39.160
couldn't there be some way to do it better? Could it conceivably be done on an earth-like planet?

20:39.760 --> 20:46.060
I couldn't see any way. The camp's arguments were there and they made sense.

20:47.480 --> 20:51.640
At this point, the famous science fiction editor, John W. Campbell, came to the rescue.

20:52.460 --> 20:59.000
Well, when it happened, the very last time I saw the late John W. Campbell,

21:00.580 --> 21:06.920
we, I was in New York and visited his office and we went out to lunch together.

21:08.400 --> 21:12.860
This was not long before his death and we sat there talking.

21:14.220 --> 21:17.940
And during their conversation, Anderson brought up the problem of constructing a large intelligent

21:17.940 --> 21:21.080
creature who could fly. Campbell suggested a way to do it.

21:22.240 --> 21:26.500
And he immediately said, well, suppose it had some sort of leg-driven

21:30.180 --> 21:33.580
supercharging bellows that would give a tremendous curse of ability.

21:36.580 --> 21:46.000
And I immediately saw that this was a way to power a winged animal, give it sufficient energy that

21:46.560 --> 21:50.180
it actually could fly in an atmosphere like our own.

21:52.720 --> 21:55.480
Although it might weigh as much as 100 tons.

21:56.140 --> 21:59.440
So on this hint, Anderson created the Ithrians of the planet Avalon.

21:59.880 --> 22:04.100
The people of the wind is probably the best known of his novels involving the Ithrians,

22:04.500 --> 22:08.480
but Anderson used them in a number of stories in his Polycystoknecht League Future History.

22:09.340 --> 22:11.240
Next time, we'll have more with Poole Anderson.

22:18.600 --> 22:21.120
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show,

22:21.440 --> 22:24.120
a production of the Permian Basin Science Fiction Association,

22:24.380 --> 22:27.340
produced in conjunction with Odessa College in Odessa, Texas.

23:07.600 --> 23:11.600
Coming up next is the Science Fiction Radio Show, so stay with us.

23:27.880 --> 23:33.280
This is the Science Fiction Radio Show, a commentary on science fiction and fantasy.

23:36.080 --> 23:37.760
And here are your hosts.

23:42.000 --> 23:43.340
This is Daryl Lane.

23:43.560 --> 23:44.280
And David Cruz.

23:44.280 --> 23:47.100
One of the present masters of science fiction and fantasy,

23:47.300 --> 23:50.720
an author whose work stretches back four decades into the golden age of science fiction,

23:50.860 --> 23:51.380
is Poole Anderson.

23:51.940 --> 23:53.060
It's hard to type Anderson.

23:53.360 --> 23:57.040
He's a full-time professional who writes all kinds of fantasy and science fiction.

23:57.500 --> 23:59.840
He's known as a writer of hard science, for example,

24:00.220 --> 24:03.720
which can be seen in novels like Tau Zero or The Man Who Counts,

24:03.980 --> 24:05.540
a fine example of world building.

24:06.020 --> 24:07.680
He's constructed two future histories.

24:08.140 --> 24:10.420
The best known one, the history of the Polycystoknecht League,

24:10.420 --> 24:14.780
contains some of his most famous characters and some of his most fascinating alien cultures.

24:15.600 --> 24:18.500
Some of the best of contemporary fantasy comes from his pen also,

24:18.720 --> 24:21.880
in novels like The Broken Sword and Three Hearts and Three Lions.

24:22.320 --> 24:24.380
And he sometimes writes tongue-in-cheek spooks,

24:24.440 --> 24:25.960
as in his novel The High Crusade,

24:26.360 --> 24:30.260
in which the medieval warriors with swords conquer a space-faring galactic civilization.

24:30.840 --> 24:33.900
Anderson has won numerous Nebula and Hugo awards for his fiction,

24:34.120 --> 24:36.860
and he served as president of the Science Fiction Writers of America.

24:37.320 --> 24:39.060
He knows the field like few others do.

24:39.060 --> 24:42.500
We asked him if science fiction has changed in the years he's been writing it.

24:43.120 --> 24:45.800
Oh yes, I've been a great many changes.

24:49.040 --> 24:51.720
Back around 1940 or so,

24:54.120 --> 25:01.440
well, practically all you could get, unless you heart back to a few writers like Wells and Bern,

25:01.840 --> 25:05.500
practically all you could get was in a few pulp magazines.

25:11.660 --> 25:12.860
Nowadays, of course,

25:14.940 --> 25:17.100
there's an overwhelming flood of it.

25:18.660 --> 25:21.600
It is not possible to read all which appears.

25:22.600 --> 25:25.580
Anderson thinks the image of science fiction has changed over the years.

25:26.480 --> 25:34.180
And also, of course, it's no longer disreputable. It's become quite respectable.

25:34.180 --> 25:41.020
Oh, you know, when I was your age, it was unthinkable

25:41.020 --> 25:44.740
that anybody could arrange a telephone interview with

25:45.720 --> 25:51.180
one of the writers of it under the auspices of a college for heaven's sake.

25:52.800 --> 25:57.300
But Lord, this was pulp fiction. It was beyond the pale.

25:59.880 --> 26:05.760
Nowadays, it's been tough in college courses and all, you know, all this other stuff, you know.

26:33.340 --> 26:36.520
He believes that science fiction has had an important impact on the public,

26:36.780 --> 26:38.900
and he tells us why he thinks science fiction is valuable.

26:40.080 --> 26:45.300
Actually, all this is kind of trivial. I think the important thing is that

26:46.080 --> 26:52.260
the basic concepts have sort of permeated the public mind.

26:52.260 --> 27:04.820
And I think people are aware in that nowadays, in a way that they never used to be aware,

27:06.120 --> 27:11.300
that the future is going to be different from the past. It may be better. It may be worse,

27:11.900 --> 27:17.720
whatever, but it's going to be different and in very fundamental ways.

27:20.040 --> 27:24.780
And they tend to accept this, be prepared for it.

27:26.360 --> 27:33.840
I often say that perhaps the most important public service that science fiction is doing

27:35.160 --> 27:40.900
is by casting a certain glamour over science and technology.

27:40.900 --> 27:50.680
It recruits a lot of young people into these fields and heaven knows we need an awful lot of

27:50.680 --> 27:56.940
scientists and technologists. Anderson is still going strong today. You'll find his latest work at any bookstore.

28:04.360 --> 28:09.360
This has been the Science Fiction Radio Show, a production of the Permian Basin Science Fiction

28:09.360 --> 28:13.260
Association produced in conjunction with Odessa College in Odessa, Texas.
