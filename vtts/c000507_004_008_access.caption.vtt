WEBVTT

00:01.380 --> 00:08.000
Okay, I know that you are working on something

00:08.000 --> 00:12.460
that

00:12.460 --> 00:21.040
has to do with sanctuary. So tell us what sanctuary is, and we can make a show
out of what you say sanctuary is, and then we'll talk about what you're doing on

00:21.040 --> 00:29.900
it. Lynn says that sanctuary... Lynn Abbey, one of my other authors, says that
sanctuary is a state of mind recognized by the American Psychiatric Association.

00:30.660 --> 00:46.540
Sanctuary is a group effort. Bob Aspyn created a geography, a god list, with the
help of Andy Offutt and the other original contributors, a political situation,

00:46.820 --> 00:59.100
and some base characters for this town. And it's called, one would say, I guess
it's the Armtid of Fantasy. It's a black hole of Calcutta type town in which

00:59.100 --> 01:11.780
magic is operative and contract sorcery is as common as wash water and what we
then he farmed it out to a group of writers and initially everyone was supposed

01:11.780 --> 01:21.780
to just write their story within the frame plot of the town and reference make
reference to other people's characters as walk-ons and that's what happened for

01:21.780 --> 01:31.680
the first couple of volumes but as we got to know each other, there became sort
of a core group which decided where the volume was going to go and, you know,

01:31.760 --> 01:37.620
where we were going to end up in that volume, what was going to happen.
Bulletins would come out as to what was going on in the town at this particular

01:37.620 --> 01:46.360
time and you would write your story and find somebody else to link your story up
with. I did a story once and then Andy picked up right, Andy Arthur picked up

01:46.360 --> 01:54.440
right where I left off and wrote the rest of that section and somebody else came
in before me so that we ended up writing sort of collaborative novels. And they

01:54.440 --> 02:07.760
are really fun. They're all, to a large degree, tongue-in-cheek, and to some
degree, pretty serious. Their philosophy is a lot of fun with them, and my

02:07.760 --> 02:15.460
character is very philosophical. We take them from

02:15.460 --> 02:28.840
a group of historical periods, which are allowable. We were supposed to stick to
Iron Age, you know, went no farther into AD than 100, but someone came up with

02:28.840 --> 02:37.560
steel. The justification of the Africans had steel at 500 BC. So now we have low
-grade steel, but it's not better than the good bronze. And I did the weapons

02:37.560 --> 02:48.600
and sent around a lot of material and other people send material on other
things. And now we've invoked some more ancient guides. And from my part, it's

02:48.600 --> 02:57.600
sort of fractured history. The sacred band in this book didn't get massacred by
Alexander at New Chaeronea. It exists. It's alive and well in Sanctuary. Every

02:57.600 --> 03:07.600
time I come across a historical character or a group of characters, I felt got a
really sad deal out of history. I stick them into the Sanctuary construct. And

03:07.600 --> 03:19.780
the stories had done very well. The Sanctuary Stories, the Peace World Group,
had its own panel at a World Fantasy Con and then again at a World Con. And it's

03:19.780 --> 03:32.680
spun off a war game, a board game, red miniatures. What else do we get, paper
dolls? All sorts of good stuff. So I spun off three novels from my characters

03:32.680 --> 03:41.680
that were in the story. And I turned in the first one to Berkeley. And I have no
idea what's going to be out. It's going to be out at the trade first. But

03:41.680 --> 03:52.820
they're just wonderful to write. They're so much fun. and the magic is just
wonderful to do, and I have all this ancient history background that I haven't

03:52.820 --> 04:02.360
been able to use in any of my science fiction or science fantasy because it
really pertains to Earth. Little details and stuff that I've dug up, I'm very

04:02.360 --> 04:09.260
strong from about 2500 B.C. to about 300 B.C. I have a lot of information. I
read a lot of dead languages.

04:12.080 --> 04:21.980
So I started to do this group of three novels, which is going to take care of
the war that we started in the group thing, but couldn't handle in the group

04:21.980 --> 04:32.940
area because all the group stories have to take place in sanctuary in this town,
and the war is in the north. So my character and his friends go north, and they

04:32.940 --> 04:44.840
deal with other parts of the continent and what's going on there. And there's
the same kind of running conflict between science and magic, But in this case,

04:45.000 --> 04:53.800
magic is the science. And the magic of the science magic thing become the gods.
So we have the gods on one side and the magicians on the other side, logic on

04:53.800 --> 05:03.400
one side, faith on the other side. And my character constantly regenerates
himself, my lead character. So he can't die, but he's just miserable. He's so

05:03.400 --> 05:13.720
unhappy. And I know he's a real character from Earth's history, but I'm not
saying who until the end of his book, Those of you that are familiar with

05:13.720 --> 05:25.160
ancient history will know who he is from the quotes, and those who aren't won't.
But I just love to do them. They are so much fun. They are like a paid vacation,

05:25.220 --> 05:34.980
and they've had very good responses. Everybody seems to like them. I get a lot
of letters about the characters. Wood and sorcery, the Homeric tradition, is

05:34.980 --> 05:43.280
very dear to my heart. I love it. I don't think it needs any justification. I
think that those values ought to be brought to people's attention once again,

05:43.540 --> 05:55.440
and Homer was writing fantasy in his days. He was writing about something 800
years in his own past when he was writing about the siege of Troy, so I'm in

05:55.440 --> 06:05.780
good company to do them, and they're the pure, the first pure fantasy that I've
done, so I'm having a ball with it. And it's really uplifting to do it very

06:05.780 --> 06:16.920
free. No terrible breaks to find out this or that because I already know pretty
much the background that I'm going to use. And they're just invigorating. I just

06:16.920 --> 06:30.320
love it. I've got a real simple yes or no question for you. Why is fantasy
getting so popular today? And we talked about the fact that not that many people

06:30.320 --> 06:38.180
really, when it comes down to it, like the hard science and hard science
fiction, and all of a sudden fantasy is very popular, more so than every date.

06:38.280 --> 06:46.740
What's your idea on why it's popular? Well, you'd be glad to hear that, from
what I hear from the publishers that's turning around right now, that there's

06:46.740 --> 06:54.920
more interest now in science fiction, or what is called science fiction. I don't
know if Star Trek 2 is technically science fiction, but things with the

06:54.920 --> 07:02.400
trappings of science fiction because of E.T. and Star Trek and those various
things. So the editors and publishers now are looking for things that they can

07:02.400 --> 07:13.360
label science fiction. But I think that happened partially from the influx of
lady readers. I don't know if you remember the real old days of science fiction,

07:13.380 --> 07:27.780
but I remember when a science fiction meeting of a group at Boston called the
Interplanetary Exploration Society with Isaac Asimov, Arthur Clarke, um god Hal

07:27.780 --> 07:41.020
Clement one guy didn't know and me i was 13 and so it was all it was pretty much
boys night out and in the last few years women in fantasy you know the princess

07:41.020 --> 07:55.500
in the tower all of that old stuff have had a resurgence i don't know what
people see in um things like the the leper books i don't remember this you know

07:55.500 --> 08:06.740
the donaldson thing i truly do not understand why people write that sort of book
he's a very nice guy and lord knows i have tried but um the whole the good and

08:06.740 --> 08:17.140
evil archetypal thing i think it goes along with you know back to the earth and
fundamentalism and uh creationism and all of this kind of rejection of the

08:17.140 --> 08:25.900
modern world and back to a simpler age. But I do also think that it's sort of
over now in that sense. And the kind of fantasy that we're writing is not that

08:25.900 --> 08:38.280
kind of high fantasy, which is pretty and dense. And I mean, this is mean and
nasty and get down with lots of ancient weaponry and, you know, the proper siege

08:38.280 --> 08:49.740
engine for the period in time, more like an ancient historical. but i think they
went over to fantasy from romance i mean if you look at the definition of

08:49.740 --> 08:59.280
romance in a dictionary you'll see that in general most dictionaries define it
as a story that takes place in a exotic locale which indeed is what science

08:59.280 --> 09:09.900
fiction is too but the romance element in fantasy is much greater and also it's
simple as far as writers producing it it's a very simple form to produce badly

09:09.900 --> 09:22.800
so a lot of young writers try to start out there you get a lot of first novels
in um fantasy I mean I've commented a couple of times on first novels that were

09:22.800 --> 09:34.080
fantasy novels because usually one applies a different standard to a first novel
at least I'm willing to apply a different standard and will accept less from

09:34.080 --> 09:43.580
somebody's first novel than I will somebody later on um and my standards for
fantasy are lower I would like them to give me a good ride take me in place

09:43.580 --> 09:51.940
remove me from the scene and just not strain my credibility too very much and
that's all I want from fantasy but I don't have time to read much of it anymore

09:51.940 --> 10:01.660
and I hear it's getting very very bad and but I hear this from other writers so
I don't know writers are very jealous as you probably have realized uh so maybe

10:01.660 --> 10:08.760
it's not getting as bad as I think it is, but there certainly are an awful lot
of books out there that say fantasy on them. I can't argue with you about that.

10:09.180 --> 10:16.460
It does take a certain amount more preparation

10:16.460 --> 10:27.700
to write science fiction. One can write bad fantasy with just the amount of
Christian mysticism one has picked up by growing up in the Midwest or wherever

10:27.700 --> 10:37.820
one has grown up and gone to Sunday school. where a good fantasy, you know, an
ancient fantasy, one that has some other cultural bias or a piece of science

10:37.820 --> 10:46.340
fiction takes a little more literacy. And I just think it's an easy place for
them to start. Why the readers keep buying bad books... You know, I said in an

10:46.340 --> 10:53.420
interview once that everybody that gets a bad book should send it back to their
publisher. And I think if we all send all the bad books back... You know, not

10:53.420 --> 11:00.600
ask for money back, just send them back. That there'd be less bad books. That
they'd get tired of receiving them all and they would eventually get the

11:00.600 --> 11:11.200
message. But that's about the only thing you can do. You can refuse to buy a bad
book or a book that doesn't meet your standards. But if you buy it, you've done

11:11.200 --> 11:21.300
them a favor, and you'll continue the problem. I don't want literature to become
like television. I don't want it to keep thinking, you know, level by level. So

11:21.300 --> 11:27.240
that they used to talk about, you know, you're writing for a 12-year-old. Now
they're talking about you're writing for an 8-year-old. When I start, they start

11:27.240 --> 11:35.100
telling me I have to write for a 6-year-old. I'm out of business because I
cannot write. I write down. I have to believe that the reader out there is write

11:35.100 --> 11:45.700
with me. And I think fantasy writers, almost without exception, write down. They
write to a level below the level that they're thinking on, and I don't think

11:45.700 --> 11:57.380
that's healthy. When we interviewed Piers Anthony, he said, I asked him a
similar question, he said that when he wants to write for fun, what he really

11:57.380 --> 12:06.640
enjoys writing is science fiction. But when he wants to make money, he writes
fantasy. And I guess that's the way it is now, that that's where the money is.

12:07.440 --> 12:20.880
That, well, I didn't know. I got a lot more money for the carrying books than I
had thought one could get for science fiction. So, I mean, the books went to

12:20.880 --> 12:29.280
auction here and then they went to auction in England and then I sold them in
Germany. And I'm getting a portion. Now, to have enough extra money to do that

12:29.280 --> 12:39.600
says something good as to what a publisher is willing to risk in science
fiction. And the books are running out. So somebody's buying him. I don't know

12:39.600 --> 12:48.800
what kind of money he's talking about, but I do know that he's been getting on
the best dollar list with books that seem to be written exclusively for an

12:48.800 --> 12:51.040
audience of fans, which I find very strange.

12:53.660 --> 13:05.200
nightmares and like that. Those are his, right? Right. I don't read that
anymore. I used to read his things when he was doing wonderful stuff way back. I

13:05.200 --> 13:15.840
don't know if you read the one about the dinosaur and the bird. He had one about
a great bird. Yeah, was that Orn? Orn. It was wonderful. I wept. I just loved

13:15.840 --> 13:29.260
it. Any writer in any area has to fight losing their edge, letting creative
pressure cause you to write something you don't want to write. Because of the

13:29.260 --> 13:38.640
way I write, I can't, I don't have that problem. That can't happen to me because
I can't manufacture a story. I get it, either a story is there for me or it

13:38.640 --> 13:44.580
isn't. I can't just sit down and say, okay, you know, I need to make some money
so I'm going to write a story and it's going to be about this or that. I have to

13:44.580 --> 13:56.240
get interested and then I go into an obsessive state. and the sanctuary things,
even though they're fantasy, allowed me to do what I couldn't do otherwise. If

13:56.240 --> 14:05.480
you think the market for science fiction is difficult, you should try the market
for a serious historical. That is a very difficult market to write. There hasn't

14:05.480 --> 14:13.180
been good money for books like that since the 50s, and that's when all good
books were written like Margaret Yorstner and those kinds of quality

14:13.180 --> 14:23.580
historicals. No one is doing it anymore. It almost cannot be done, Creation,
with just the exception of Prove the Rule, the Gore Vidal book. I promised

14:23.580 --> 14:30.980
those Sanctuary characters, if they would just stay in these little tiny spaces,
I would get them their own deal. So I did. I got them a deal for three books,

14:30.980 --> 14:38.900
and they're very happy, and they're giving me good book back. But I can't, I
just couldn't, I wouldn't know where to start to create. That's why I don't

14:38.900 --> 14:48.340
write for magazines, because they're looking for you to write in a particular
slot and to create almost a little joke that short story for me and I don't care

14:48.340 --> 15:02.140
for it. I think if you write an honest book and you have something to say, that
the readership that I want will find it. And that's all I'm asking. Because, you

15:02.140 --> 15:15.060
know, there's always a silhouette romance for somebody who can't read my stuff.
And I don't pretend to write for everybody. And if I hit our bestseller, we've

15:15.060 --> 15:26.920
got 120,000 out of Earthdreams. If we've got 150, we might hit the New York
Times list. But the last volume of These Were Things, which was called Storm

15:26.920 --> 15:36.280
Season, was on the top 50 at Dalton's and Walden books nationwide when it came
out. And it's a phenomena. It just happens. I don't think you can sit down and

15:36.280 --> 15:44.920
plan to write a book that will be both a good book and a book that will be a
bestseller. I don't think you can make that many compromises. And if a writer

15:44.920 --> 15:50.680
loses their edge for making money, writes things that they don't believe in,
writes books for the wrong reason,

15:53.460 --> 16:02.420
it's just trade-off. In the end, you're not alive and your books are there, and
that's what's left. And I tend to want to write for building a corpus of work

16:02.420 --> 16:10.120
that I think has some value. I mean, you're getting into people's heads. It's a
hell of an opportunity to waste. Somebody takes the time and the effort to sit

16:10.120 --> 16:21.320
down and read your book, not only go out and find it, but bring it home and turn
off the TV and shout out to kids and let the thought out and read your book is a

16:21.320 --> 16:34.040
tremendous, almost an honor. I love it that people read your book, let you into
their head, become one with you for that amount of time. And you ought to have

16:34.040 --> 16:44.360
something to offer, something to give them. We do occasionally other things
under pseudonyms, political things, espionage, politics, stuff I know about

16:44.360 --> 16:55.120
intelligence gathering. In a book like that, one has to pay attention to
formula. You have to have a certain amount of action in a book. But I also try

16:55.120 --> 17:02.580
to have a certain amount of action in my fiction because I think story, you
should never lose sight of the fact that there has to be story. But to write

17:02.580 --> 17:15.180
just for money, I've never tried to do it that way. I write what I want to write
and then I try to get money for it afterwards. I wouldn't know where to start.

17:16.600 --> 17:28.500
He's probably written many more books than I am. Is he older? I think he's
about... I think he's pretty close to 50, yeah. I think at that point one's

17:28.500 --> 17:37.880
trying to cover one's bets too. And more power to him. The more books that do
well, the better off everybody is in this market. Books of any sort. it's just

17:37.880 --> 17:46.260
nice to know that people are reading but again I haven't read those books so I
don't know whether they have good content or they don't have good content but if

17:46.260 --> 17:58.680
somebody wants to write science fiction they should be writing science fiction
and he's a good writer or it was when I read him at the time of porn that he was

17:58.680 --> 18:13.420
a good strong writer but it's just a sad state of affairs if that is indeed
still the case Okay, that's my list of questions thanks very much it's been very

18:13.420 --> 18:25.400
enjoyable I only interview people whom I enjoy reading their books and I don't
interview anybody who I don't read and who I don't like their stuff so it's a

18:25.400 --> 18:36.400
pleasure to get into your head too after your being in my head for so long
That's wonderful I had a great time This is the most free that I've been able to

18:36.400 --> 18:47.120
be with somebody. Well, good. Let me ask you, if it would be any trouble, if I
could send my Kerrion books to you with postage and all that stuff, and have you

18:47.120 --> 18:58.160
signed them? Oh, certainly. And if there's room, stick the Xerox, if that's
convenient. Absolutely. Okay, I would appreciate that. I'm a book collector,

18:58.240 --> 19:06.940
which is how I got into science fiction. I think I'm a couple of years younger
than you. I was born in 1948. Yeah, I'm 46. Right in there, that's the slot.

19:07.240 --> 19:18.020
Yeah, right. So we kind of went through the same social time. I used to live in
New York for a while. We lived in upstate New York and stayed down in the

19:18.020 --> 19:27.280
village for most of one summer. And we had a really good time up there. I like
that part of the country. I only came back to Texas because of economic

19:27.280 --> 19:38.340
exigencies. But it's kind of nice out here because we do have a radio show out
here, who would have thunk that? I don't know. I think you have to go to New

19:38.340 --> 19:45.960
York and then you have to leave New York. Everybody should have the experience,
but no one should be sentenced there for any long period of time. I mean, I

19:45.960 --> 19:57.000
don't think I could be as creative there. It's so noisy, mental noise. A lot of
noise there. Yeah, I can appreciate that. Okay, I'll get you my books one of

19:57.000 --> 20:06.540
these days, and I'll try to get them out pretty fast. I do appreciate that. I'll
write the shows probably sometime in February, and we'll voice them over and get

20:06.540 --> 20:16.140
you copies of them. Okay. And I sure look forward to seeing what you put out.
I'll have to read The Sanctuary stuff. I have not read that because I did read

20:16.140 --> 20:24.620
Donaldson. I do try to read some fantasy, but I just flat don't enjoy it as
much. Did you enjoy that Donaldson stuff? No, I did not. It wasn't just me,

20:24.720 --> 20:34.380
then. I did it. I read it, in fact, just between me and you and the gatepost. I
think the three of us are going to flip a coin and whoever loses gets to

20:34.380 --> 20:41.740
interview him. Although he's a hell of a nice guy. I've met him, he really is.
But I just don't think I'm up to doing an interview on that stuff. I wouldn't

20:41.740 --> 20:48.820
know what to answer. I know, that's the problem. What can you say? And one of
our guys is an English professor, Tolkien scholar and all that. Maybe he could

20:48.820 --> 21:00.020
do it. Yeah, that's what I'm hoping he loses. But again, I really look forward
to seeing what you put out in the future. and, uh... Listen, if you would return

21:00.020 --> 21:09.360
it, you know, within a year or so, I'll also send you the Choragini book. Oh,
sure. Okay? Yeah. You know, I've finished. I've been through it, and I've got a

21:09.360 --> 21:18.480
dog ear. You'll have to deal with my dog ears. Oh, yeah, no problem whatsoever.
I appreciate that. Yeah, okay. I will send enough postage to cover that then and

21:18.480 --> 21:28.700
all that. I don't want you to be out anything. That's a very nice gesture. Okay.
Janet, it's been really nice. Thanks for considering, and we'll talk to you

21:28.700 --> 21:31.820
later, I'm sure. You really enjoyed it. Bye-bye now. Bye-bye.
