00:01.400 --> 00:01.840
Okay.

00:04.220 --> 00:05.100
Okay, we're rolling.

00:05.760 --> 00:11.860
Okay, I am very unknowledgeable about collectors, so some of the questions I'm going to ask

00:11.860 --> 00:12.980
you are pretty basic.

00:14.320 --> 00:15.720
All right, that's fine.

00:15.840 --> 00:19.160
I assume many of your listeners will be the same.

00:19.220 --> 00:19.760
Right, exactly.

00:20.600 --> 00:22.480
Okay, the first question is a pretty obvious one.

00:22.700 --> 00:25.360
Can you just briefly tell me how you got started as a collector?

00:26.020 --> 00:29.340
Well, I guess we have to go back quite a ways.

00:29.340 --> 00:36.760
I got interested in science fiction in high school, as many people do, and once I started

00:36.760 --> 00:42.940
finding that, hey, out there in the big world, they have newsstands that sell books, why I

00:42.940 --> 00:49.000
bought everything that I could get my hands on for many, many years, and I really got

00:49.000 --> 00:51.200
started as a serious collector, however.

00:52.100 --> 00:56.840
I have my wife to thank for that, and she sort of wishes she hadn't said it sometimes,

00:56.840 --> 01:03.740
I think, because I was telling her about the books that I'd read when I was in high

01:03.740 --> 01:09.220
school, which happened to be a series of hardcover, juvenile science fiction books published by

01:09.220 --> 01:13.440
the Winston Company, and how I'd been in love with those things, and read them several times,

01:13.460 --> 01:15.140
and had fondled them a lot, and so on.

01:16.080 --> 01:19.640
And she says, oh, there are used book dealers.

01:20.820 --> 01:23.620
They could probably find copies of those, and you could buy them.

01:24.210 --> 01:25.880
And I hadn't even considered that.

01:26.220 --> 01:31.300
In the past, I'd only bought what I'd found at newsstands, and so when the time came,

01:31.880 --> 01:35.840
and I started sending these lists to all the dealers, well, they had all these other fantastic

01:35.840 --> 01:39.420
books also, and it's sort of mushroom from there.

01:41.680 --> 01:42.440
Okay, good.

01:43.760 --> 01:46.800
Could you tell me what kinds of things you concentrate on collecting?

01:47.480 --> 01:53.240
Well, I once gave a talk on this subject, and I titled it The Complete Science Fiction

01:53.240 --> 01:55.960
Collector, Confessions of a Packrat.

01:56.760 --> 02:02.660
In other words, I'm very, very versatile and Catholic in my taste.

02:03.220 --> 02:10.860
I don't like all kinds of things as much as equally, but I collect anything that's published

02:10.860 --> 02:16.840
in science fiction in fantasy vein, I get my hands on, and then I can afford, which means almost.

02:17.240 --> 02:20.240
I've got copies of almost every book that's been published.

02:21.920 --> 02:24.000
Okay, now I'm not sure I still understand that.

02:24.060 --> 02:28.140
I'm not sure if there's a term for this, but like, I'm talking about categories like paperbacks,

02:28.340 --> 02:29.820
pulps, hardbacks, things of that sort.

02:31.200 --> 02:35.260
I started out with paperbacks and the Digest magazine.

02:35.980 --> 02:41.660
I've gone back in terms of picking up the old pulp magazines to the point where now I have

02:41.660 --> 02:46.720
almost all of them that were ever published, starting back with Weird Tales in 1923 and

02:46.720 --> 02:48.540
amazing stories in 1926.

02:49.480 --> 02:54.080
I'm very proud of my complete collection of Weird Tales, as I understand there's only about

02:54.080 --> 03:00.560
30 copies, there's so many systems, and just about as good on astounding science fiction,

03:00.700 --> 03:01.120
for example.

03:01.720 --> 03:08.100
Recently, I have been branching out into hardbacks also, but I'm a long, long ways from completing that.

03:09.380 --> 03:11.120
What about just plain old paperbacks?

03:11.840 --> 03:15.200
Well, I have about $14,000, $15,000.

03:15.260 --> 03:16.000
Is that enough for you?

03:17.400 --> 03:20.980
Yeah, do you try to pick up all of those or do you just take certain kinds?

03:21.200 --> 03:26.140
There's always a problem in making the, where do you draw the line?

03:26.740 --> 03:29.760
But I basically get everything that's clearly science fiction,

03:30.520 --> 03:32.340
everything that's clearly fantasy.

03:32.780 --> 03:38.220
I kind of draw the line someplace in the horror vein to one side and maybe fairy tales on the

03:38.220 --> 03:38.780
other side.

03:39.280 --> 03:45.720
And sometimes I'll draw the line at an Adam Baum story that's set in the near future,

03:45.720 --> 03:46.740
something like that.

03:47.580 --> 03:53.060
But basically, I get every paperback in science fiction and fantasy.

03:54.120 --> 03:58.460
In multiple editions, I might say, every time a new cover comes out, why I'll buy the new edition.

04:00.920 --> 04:03.660
Okay, now this question is really going to show my ignorance, but

04:04.500 --> 04:06.060
how do you accumulate your books?

04:06.160 --> 04:09.500
Do you go about it by cold methodical planning and go right to the publisher?

04:09.680 --> 04:10.980
Do you just search around bookstores?

04:11.080 --> 04:11.840
How do you go about that?

04:12.200 --> 04:15.420
No, I buy most of mine these days used.

04:15.420 --> 04:22.580
I'll buy the ones I like better new so that I have a mint copy on paperbacks, especially.

04:23.160 --> 04:25.760
But an awful lot of them, I buy them used.

04:25.940 --> 04:28.340
Just fairly recent, just in the local bookstores.

04:29.100 --> 04:33.640
Lubbock is blessed with about seven or eight, so I make the rounds on a regular basis,

04:33.880 --> 04:35.500
just pick up whatever I happen to come across.

04:36.120 --> 04:38.980
Sooner or later, I find most everything in the recent things.

04:40.000 --> 04:42.900
And on older things, I go through mail order dealers.

04:45.320 --> 04:51.480
Okay, then you, I assume, and I know through Bill that there are publications and so forth.

04:51.640 --> 04:55.180
I mean, how do you know how much is coming out?

04:55.240 --> 04:56.060
Do you have some kind of checklist?

04:56.520 --> 05:01.740
The best source by far is the news magazine of science fiction called Locust.

05:02.740 --> 05:05.980
And science fiction chronicle also has these sort of things.

05:06.120 --> 05:09.920
They attempt to list every book that comes out in the field.

05:09.920 --> 05:13.860
In fact, they're even wider in their categories than I am, and they include

05:13.860 --> 05:16.420
academic type books and things like those too.

05:17.120 --> 05:20.700
And every month, they will list everything that's come out by every publisher.

05:20.820 --> 05:28.440
Most of the publishers send them copies, and the ones that don't, they still will write down there

05:28.440 --> 05:31.320
that they know this book exists, but they haven't seen a copy.

05:31.960 --> 05:34.240
They also give many reviews on many of them.

05:35.780 --> 05:39.920
And I assume for the, I call it pulse, I'm not sure what the term is.

05:39.960 --> 05:41.400
I assume for those, you just have subscriptions.

05:42.640 --> 05:47.440
There are no pulp magazines been published since 1955 or so.

05:48.100 --> 05:50.400
They sort of went the way of the dinosaurs.

05:51.180 --> 05:59.320
But their successors are the digest size magazines, as well as such large oversized ones as

05:59.320 --> 06:05.220
the one that's on me and Twilight Zone currently.

06:06.200 --> 06:08.340
And so I buy those on the newsstand every month.

06:09.660 --> 06:15.140
Okay, have you ever run across any valuable finds or little nuggets just by accident,

06:15.220 --> 06:15.960
just browsing around?

06:16.380 --> 06:18.240
Not as many as I would like.

06:19.660 --> 06:20.640
Occasionally, I do.

06:20.960 --> 06:25.380
I pick up quite a few, you know, moderately rare things.

06:25.380 --> 06:30.120
Say, for example, for half a cover price at a used bookstore.

06:30.780 --> 06:34.880
But that's getting to be more and more rare as the collectors have got all the valuable things

06:35.580 --> 06:36.460
grabbed up.

06:37.400 --> 06:40.560
So most of them I have to pay more or less market value.

06:41.000 --> 06:46.080
Actually, one other source I didn't mention for many of my books, because I buy so many,

06:46.200 --> 06:51.100
I'll actually buy a person's entire collection just to get the books that I especially want,

06:51.120 --> 06:52.800
if there's some older, rarer ones among them.

06:54.260 --> 06:57.040
I assume then you have a complete set of the Ace Doubles?

06:58.400 --> 07:01.200
Actually, I'm still missing one that's been rather elusive.

07:01.440 --> 07:03.400
But other than that, I have all the Ace Doubles, yeah.

07:03.800 --> 07:04.620
Is that D13?

07:05.040 --> 07:06.160
I have a D13.

07:06.480 --> 07:06.960
Yes, I do.

07:07.120 --> 07:11.380
I was very lucky to get that before the prices started escalating as much as they have.

07:11.880 --> 07:16.480
And I got it from one of the major dealers and I paid what now is,

07:17.240 --> 07:20.020
three or four years later, would seem to be a real steal.

07:21.680 --> 07:22.880
Okay, what about traveling?

07:23.060 --> 07:24.660
Do you ever travel just to make collecting trips?

07:25.380 --> 07:30.360
No, I combine collecting trips with whenever I happen to be traveling.

07:31.540 --> 07:36.480
I remember one time, not too long ago, we visited relatives in Madison, Wisconsin,

07:37.300 --> 07:41.820
and I had to mail all the books back because there wasn't room in the rabbit for the family in the box.

07:42.580 --> 07:47.960
And my wife said, no way are we going to sit in here with several boxes of books.

07:47.960 --> 07:52.140
So, but I don't make deliberate trips just to buy things.

07:53.920 --> 07:59.900
Okay, are you a reader and a fan of science fiction first and then a collector?

08:00.160 --> 08:01.860
Or are you in the field principally for collecting?

08:02.280 --> 08:03.800
Yeah, people keep asking me that.

08:03.980 --> 08:05.480
How much of this stuff do you read?

08:06.080 --> 08:12.300
Well, the answer is as much as I have time for, which in my rather busy schedule is between 50

08:12.300 --> 08:14.160
and 70 books a year I estimate.

08:14.740 --> 08:17.820
And I'll probably add a thousand to the collection in a year.

08:18.020 --> 08:20.040
So I certainly don't read a very big percentage.

08:20.900 --> 08:23.580
But I pick and choose among what I've got.

08:24.260 --> 08:27.600
Since I have less hardbacks and since they cost more in general,

08:27.980 --> 08:32.520
I feel some sort of a semi obligation to try to read something if I bought it in hardback.

08:34.880 --> 08:39.900
Okay, I'm sure you're asked this question from people who know that you're a collector.

08:40.860 --> 08:44.200
Just from the psychological point of view, why do you collect?

08:46.520 --> 08:47.620
Because it's there.

08:48.700 --> 08:53.020
That's actually, I suppose, a difficult question for anyone to answer.

08:53.140 --> 08:55.780
First of all, you have to love books or whatever you're collecting.

08:56.120 --> 08:58.240
I mean, this is the collector's mania.

08:58.380 --> 09:06.200
There's lots of people that collect anything from Mads books to old Avon bottles, we're having

09:06.200 --> 09:11.540
sex. And I collect what I enjoy from other standpoints.

09:11.580 --> 09:12.860
I enjoy the artwork on them.

09:13.020 --> 09:14.220
I enjoy reading the things.

09:14.660 --> 09:21.480
I like to read at least the representative book by any author that's important in the field,

09:21.960 --> 09:22.640
and so on.

09:23.100 --> 09:24.660
And I just love books.

09:24.820 --> 09:25.600
I love to handle them.

09:25.720 --> 09:29.120
I love to sort them, catalog them, put them away, just look at them.

09:29.480 --> 09:34.620
And that's what I do with a fair portion of my spare time, I guess.

09:37.020 --> 09:37.600
Okay, you...

09:37.600 --> 09:39.440
Well, there's one more aspect of this.

09:39.560 --> 09:45.460
Once you really get the collecting bug, and that is the completest attitude.

09:46.040 --> 09:48.700
That is, for example, you decide you want to collect something.

09:48.800 --> 09:51.900
I don't care what it is, but let's say it's the Ace Devils.

09:52.020 --> 09:53.080
You use that as an example.

09:53.620 --> 09:57.440
A lot of people have gone after them, for example, for the prices are growing up.

09:59.060 --> 10:02.940
But once you decide you want to get the Ace Devils, you don't care which ones are good ones

10:02.940 --> 10:04.900
and which ones are bad ones in terms of the story.

10:04.900 --> 10:08.140
All you're concerned about is getting a copy of every one.

10:09.540 --> 10:13.220
And that same thing goes especially for people that collect the magazines,

10:13.260 --> 10:15.700
because there it's pretty obvious whether you've got them all,

10:15.700 --> 10:18.140
because they're all nicely laid out by months.

10:20.740 --> 10:23.780
Okay, I think you sort of halfway answered this one a minute ago.

10:24.040 --> 10:24.760
If you think...

10:24.760 --> 10:28.180
If you would just repeat yourself, go ahead and tell me, and I won't ask this.

10:28.240 --> 10:30.400
But I asked you, why do you collect?

10:31.400 --> 10:32.580
Why science fiction books?

10:32.680 --> 10:33.420
Why not something else?

10:33.420 --> 10:35.940
Like Mysteries or Westerns or Seashells or something?

10:36.160 --> 10:37.400
Because I love science fiction.

10:38.260 --> 10:44.160
Something we haven't gotten into the conversation yet is I hear at Texas Tech,

10:45.040 --> 10:51.020
I also am involved in helping the team teach the course in science fiction.

10:51.360 --> 10:54.400
We have a special course through our honors program,

10:54.740 --> 10:57.860
and there are three or four of us every semester.

10:58.360 --> 11:03.900
Team teach this thing to a small group, and we try to teach them principles about writing,

11:04.020 --> 11:07.820
also the creative writing course, very much a discussion course, and so on.

11:08.300 --> 11:09.420
I just love science fiction.

11:10.540 --> 11:13.300
I don't mind reading an occasional mystery, let's say.

11:13.400 --> 11:18.140
I haven't read a Western in 20 years, but I've read lots of science fiction,

11:18.280 --> 11:20.860
and since that's what I like to read, that's what I like to collect.

11:21.540 --> 11:24.720
Also, I might say that many of the older science fiction books are

11:26.140 --> 11:30.960
more valuable to collectors in general than many of those in other fields.

11:32.580 --> 11:34.600
Say Comparable Age and Publisher.

11:37.100 --> 11:41.300
Okay, you also sort of answered this one a minute ago too, but let me ask you.

11:41.360 --> 11:45.040
Let's say with the books that you collected sometimes,

11:45.320 --> 11:47.180
let's say your collection of Weird Tales or something,

11:47.760 --> 11:49.080
what do you do with those books?

11:49.400 --> 11:51.720
You take them out and read them or handle them or what?

11:51.720 --> 11:55.540
I handle them to the extent of cataloging them.

11:55.680 --> 11:58.380
I have a very extensive catalog system, as you might guess.

11:59.320 --> 12:00.880
I'll look at them occasionally.

12:01.540 --> 12:05.540
On the Weird Tales, especially in a few things like this, I have people that

12:06.120 --> 12:12.200
I correspond with other collectors and so on, and some of them who can't afford to spend

12:12.200 --> 12:15.340
several hundred dollars to some of the early issues, let's say,

12:15.660 --> 12:19.040
and might want to read some story that's never been reproduced or something like that.

12:19.360 --> 12:21.620
I'll actually make a photocopy of it for them.

12:22.260 --> 12:23.960
My expenses and time.

12:26.480 --> 12:29.220
That's one thing I do with some of them.

12:31.200 --> 12:36.960
Okay, and you must be fairly knowledgeable about other collectors and the sources and so forth.

12:37.140 --> 12:42.300
Are there people who collect the science fiction books simply because it's

12:43.120 --> 12:46.640
oh, I don't know, because it's just something to collect.

12:46.880 --> 12:49.640
Maybe you're not fans, you don't care anything about science fiction.

12:49.640 --> 12:52.860
Yeah, maybe as an investment, let's say.

12:54.340 --> 13:00.380
My advice to somebody who wants to do that is you've got to know a heck of a lot about this

13:00.380 --> 13:05.060
field before you're likely to be very successful at it, going about it from that standpoint.

13:07.400 --> 13:12.800
Just because something as old as it necessarily means that it's especially valuable,

13:13.220 --> 13:16.560
and what's real, it would be really difficult from the investor standpoint,

13:16.560 --> 13:22.460
from somebody who knew very little about the field, is to know which books to pick up now,

13:22.560 --> 13:25.340
because 10 years from now, they're going to be worth a lot.

13:26.020 --> 13:30.200
In fact, that's kind of hard for me to guess, and I'm sure in heck no more about it than a lot of

13:30.200 --> 13:34.140
people do. You're not in it for the investment, are you?

13:34.180 --> 13:39.040
No, I'm not. But I'm thinking about comic book collectors, especially.

13:39.880 --> 13:45.580
There's a heck of a lot of people in that field, while many of the most fanatical ones clearly

13:45.580 --> 13:53.340
love comic books, there are people that see this fantastic way that the prices go up on those things

13:53.340 --> 14:00.620
and want to buy them just as an investment. In fact, the paperback books are kind of getting

14:00.620 --> 14:05.840
in that category too, an extent, because they are publishing price guides for them now, and they

14:05.840 --> 14:12.880
hadn't done that until very recently. In your particular line of collecting, what is considered

14:12.880 --> 14:21.380
the ultimate? The ultimate. I'd say the rarest item I've got is my volume one, number one, Weird Tales.

14:24.700 --> 14:31.200
But there are, well, it depends on what you're talking about. For example,

14:32.460 --> 14:37.720
here's an example a lot of people would know about. Frank Herbert's Dune, hard cover, the first

14:37.720 --> 14:44.260
edition, is worth a great deal of money, simply because Dune wasn't that well-known when it first

14:44.260 --> 14:49.160
came out, didn't attract that much attention until slowly over several years, and that first

14:49.160 --> 14:56.440
hard cover edition is extremely hard to find. So that in good condition, I understand that

14:57.000 --> 15:01.880
a first edition is worth a thousand bucks. Well, I don't have a copy of it, I wouldn't mind having

15:01.880 --> 15:07.460
a copy at all, but I wouldn't pay that money for it. But I know somebody who found one in the grudge

15:07.460 --> 15:11.300
sale in Lubbock and bugged the heck out of me, it wasn't me.

15:13.880 --> 15:19.480
How much can a really valuable single paperback cost?

15:20.420 --> 15:27.300
Well, I could tell you the highest price I've heard anybody charge for anything, and that was,

15:28.200 --> 15:36.600
and I don't know if they got it, this was the asking price. It was $175 for out in the Canary House

15:36.600 --> 15:42.920
by Kurt Vonnegut, and that book, which is his only collection of short stories and which are all

15:42.920 --> 15:49.060
unabashedly science fiction, he vows he'll never allow reprinted as long as he lives, and there

15:49.060 --> 15:52.960
aren't all that many copies available, so the price of that thing has been really escalating.

15:53.460 --> 15:55.940
I got my copy for $3, I don't mind telling you.

15:56.940 --> 15:58.620
What's the most you paid for a paperback?

15:59.800 --> 16:03.720
I think about 20, and I don't do that for very many, I assure you.

16:05.060 --> 16:11.160
By the way, this isn't a formal question, but do you happen to have a paperback copy of the

16:11.160 --> 16:13.380
Hillman edition of the Dying Earth, the first paperback?

16:13.780 --> 16:19.740
No, as a matter of fact, that's another one that I could have mentioned that's in that pretty good

16:21.160 --> 16:28.420
category, and Jack Vance in general is a very collectible person, and I've got everything

16:28.420 --> 16:32.340
that's say relatively accessible, but I don't have something like that.

16:33.100 --> 16:37.040
I do have his first hardback, by the way, Vandals of the Boyd, a lot of people wouldn't mind having

16:37.040 --> 16:45.760
that. Okay, one thing that I wonder about with paperback and digest collectors like yourself,

16:47.060 --> 16:52.360
seems to me that paperbacks don't last an awfully long time. How do you store and preserve them

16:52.360 --> 16:58.700
for the future? That's a very good question. First of all, they're going to deteriorate no

16:58.700 --> 17:06.440
matter what you do. You can slow it down. Here in Lubbock, I've got, my stuff is down a basement,

17:06.880 --> 17:11.500
and the temperature stays fairly constant, and the humidity is relatively low, and it's not too

17:11.500 --> 17:18.840
far from ideal book storage conditions just automatically. The rare things, especially I do

17:18.840 --> 17:28.380
put in plastic bags, and I also have access to, my wife is a librarian up at Texas Tech, and so I

17:28.380 --> 17:34.600
have access to her, she's actually the one who does the book repairs, among other things, and all

17:34.600 --> 17:39.560
the prepping of books, that sort of thing. So I have access to her facilities for repairing things.

17:39.940 --> 17:46.800
If I have a copy, say the glue is coming out, I can re-glue it with good grade library glue,

17:46.800 --> 17:51.820
and I've gotten pretty good at making repairs that are fairly unnoticeable, and I can make a pretty

17:51.820 --> 17:59.140
beat-up looking copy look halfway decent. That's a lot better to have one that you don't have to do

17:59.140 --> 18:03.600
that, and if I had a really rare one, I would simply put it in the bag and not touch it anymore and

18:03.600 --> 18:09.540
hope it won't crumble. I suppose for something you're buying that's an older copy, no matter what it

18:09.540 --> 18:14.540
is, that the value is mostly dependent on the condition it's in? The condition is extremely

18:14.540 --> 18:21.040
important. Yes, you can have a rare book that's in perfect condition and expects to pay anywhere

18:21.040 --> 18:29.380
from two to ten times as much as a poorer copy, because many of the real serious collectors

18:29.380 --> 18:35.560
are conditioned freaks, they won't accept one unless it's just in pretty darn nice shape,

18:35.900 --> 18:40.960
and something that's been, you know, read and passed around and survived through several

18:41.800 --> 18:45.900
trips to the used bookstore certainly isn't in that condition. You pretty much have to get one

18:45.900 --> 18:55.000
that was a one-owner book. Okay, what, do you have any particular goals at this time, rather than just

18:55.000 --> 18:58.600
keep, you know, adding on the new books that are coming out? Is there any particular thing you're

18:58.600 --> 19:04.800
aiming at? Not really, which is one reason too, why, you know, the fact that I don't have vans

19:04.800 --> 19:10.620
as dying as an example, I sure I would like to get a copy and hopefully I'll run across, be in the

19:10.620 --> 19:17.180
right place at the right time one day, but I'm not pursuing it fanatically. If I really said I

19:17.180 --> 19:21.820
got to have that book no matter what and I'm willing to pay the price and write to every dealer in

19:21.820 --> 19:27.140
the country that I can find the name for, somebody would come up with a copy, sure, but since I so

19:27.140 --> 19:32.180
widespread, anything I don't get at any particular time, I assume, well, there's a fair chance I'll

19:32.180 --> 19:37.840
get it later. And certainly I have the dying earth and I'm teen other editions, take that as an example.

19:38.380 --> 19:42.780
And I've read it, you know, so it would be nice to have that first edition.

19:43.640 --> 19:49.360
There's an awful lot of things that I don't have, even then, and I'll never have everything, so what

19:49.360 --> 19:54.460
the heck? Is there any particular item that you especially covet?

19:59.140 --> 20:09.900
I don't really know. I could make a short list of a dozen that would be highest priority in terms of

20:09.900 --> 20:16.800
this is what I pay the most money for. Some of the Philippe-Hosé farmers rare rarest books.

20:17.900 --> 20:24.160
The the Vans ones, these guys are both highly collectible anyway, and there'll be a few others.

20:26.120 --> 20:30.400
Would you sell your collection or any portion of it for a high enough price?

20:31.440 --> 20:38.680
Probably not now. I do know somebody who retired and took around the world trip on selling his.

20:42.340 --> 20:49.080
Where would the greatest collections of science fiction material of your type in existence be?

20:49.080 --> 20:57.020
Well, that's easy. Forest J. Ackerman is the was sort of a number one fan. He's pretty old man now,

20:57.420 --> 21:05.780
but he has been active in the field for, I don't know, well over 50 years, and he has

21:05.780 --> 21:13.780
repeatedly bought everything, including all kinds of knickknacks and toys and and first edition

21:13.780 --> 21:20.040
paintings and just literally over a hundred thousand pieces, I understand, which is all in a

21:20.040 --> 21:27.640
he's donated it to, I forget and forgot one, one of the California cities San Francisco, I think,

21:28.400 --> 21:36.620
but anyway, and anyway, it is reputed to be by far the most fantastic collection that's

21:36.620 --> 21:43.260
ever been put together. By the way, there are some libraries now, academic type libraries and others

21:43.260 --> 21:48.900
who have extremely good collections of science fiction. Within Texas, for example, A&M has a

21:48.900 --> 21:55.720
special collection that that I don't think has as many pieces, but probably has more value than

21:55.720 --> 22:03.040
the collection. I know they have a complete set of weird tales, for example. Yeah, we managed to talk

22:03.040 --> 22:09.440
to Forest Ackerman, interviewed him in person at all the Den Venge and to a couple years ago.

22:09.960 --> 22:13.980
So I think I knew the answer to that before I asked you. Right, that's all right, not everybody

22:13.980 --> 22:22.640
listening to you well. Yeah, is there any kind of, I don't know, association group publications,

22:23.080 --> 22:29.540
etc., that go along with the collecting business? Not that I know of specifically for science fiction,

22:29.740 --> 22:35.860
there have been several little amateur publications with titles like Paperback Quarterly,

22:35.860 --> 22:42.800
for example, that have to do with collecting paperbacks exclusively. Mostly what you have is

22:43.400 --> 22:47.820
well, there are various kinds of guides of course and indexes. Other than that,

22:48.160 --> 22:52.000
you just get catalogs from dealers and start looking around.

22:53.780 --> 22:58.320
Would you have any advice for a beginner, somebody who loves science fiction but had not

22:58.320 --> 23:03.280
collected anything, who wanted to start? Okay, probably what most people will do when they

23:03.280 --> 23:09.320
start is they will pick a favorite author or author and try to get all the books by that person.

23:09.720 --> 23:14.180
Somebody with the limited budget just starting thinks, you know, that's a pretty good first

23:14.180 --> 23:19.660
step to say, for example, get every book a copy of some edition of every book that Robert A.

23:19.740 --> 23:25.000
Heinle has written or Andre Norton or who are you name it, whoever the person happens to like.

23:26.040 --> 23:31.380
And once they do that, and if they start getting the collecting bug, then pretty soon they'll

23:31.380 --> 23:37.880
want to trade in those later printings for first editions. And then if they've really gotten into

23:37.880 --> 23:42.360
it, they'll want to trade in those first, beat up first editions for better copies of the first

23:42.360 --> 23:47.600
editions when they do it. They'll probably start expanding into other authors. Or some people will

23:47.600 --> 23:52.640
do it in terms of say, for example, a specific publisher trying to get everything. Or in the case

23:52.640 --> 23:58.120
of the magazines, as I say, that's easy. They might start with, let's say, astounding analog

23:58.560 --> 24:04.000
or magazine of fantasy and science fiction or something like that or amazing stories, whatever.

24:04.860 --> 24:10.060
And maybe brand shout as much as their time, money and inclination. Allow them to.

24:12.420 --> 24:18.020
If you decided, I understand from Bill that you'd also sell a little bit. If you decided to do that

24:18.020 --> 24:23.160
as a living, is it possible to make a living off of it? Not without one. Heck of a lot of time and

24:23.160 --> 24:28.740
effort. Yeah, I basically, what I'm doing is selling off duplicates that I wind up with,

24:28.820 --> 24:35.920
either from buying people's collections or from, if I find a really rare bug, even if I have it,

24:35.960 --> 24:42.820
I'll pick it up if it's cheap. And also, you know, when I buy a full collection, there'll be lots

24:42.820 --> 24:48.320
of duplicates in there. Or I just buy something just to upgrade my copy. Because I did, there was

24:48.320 --> 24:53.340
many years there when I was impressed about condition on getting more and more so myself.

24:53.680 --> 24:58.420
And so I'm still weeding out beat up copies and putting better copies in the places.

24:59.060 --> 25:07.040
So, but it's a part time on the side type thing I do send out. I have a small list of people that

25:07.040 --> 25:13.120
are on a mailing list that gets an occasional catalog I put out or some people send me one list.

25:13.120 --> 25:18.580
And if I have duplicates, why I'll tell them, hey, I got this. And they're able to sell it to

25:18.580 --> 25:26.260
cheaper people. Okay, I just have a couple more, John. Let's see, how should I put this one?

25:28.260 --> 25:30.900
Like, what's going to happen in the future? You know, I assume you're going to be collecting

25:30.900 --> 25:33.860
for most of the rest of your life and so forth. What do you think is going to happen to your

25:33.860 --> 25:38.800
collection? Do you have any plans or is it just? I'll tell you one thing. I hate to think about

25:38.800 --> 25:49.080
moving. But other than that, my wife has talked about that briefly a little bit once in a while.

25:49.300 --> 25:54.420
I would expect, you know, if something unexpected happens, sometime after retirement,

25:54.440 --> 26:00.600
they'll probably be interested in selling off at least most of it. But that's a long way down the

26:00.600 --> 26:05.960
road. She said donate it to some library. Well, if she's left with the decision, she does what she

26:05.960 --> 26:11.840
wants. But I would want to recoup some of the things, some of what we got into it.

26:13.720 --> 26:17.740
Okay, I think you answered this one a little earlier partially. But let me, as I wind down,

26:17.840 --> 26:22.060
just do one more try at it. What part of your collection are you say you're the most proud of?

26:23.400 --> 26:30.180
My pulp magazines, I think, is sort of my own favorite among all the things. You know, people

26:30.180 --> 26:35.060
come into the house, visitors that know nothing about science fiction, and I always trot them

26:35.060 --> 26:41.180
downstairs and show them the collection. Kind of funny to watch somebody, you hand them one of

26:41.180 --> 26:47.160
those old pulp magazines, give them one that isn't crumbling too badly. And then they start looking at

26:47.160 --> 26:52.400
all the old ads from the 30s or whatever. It's kind of a history lesson just to go through the

26:52.400 --> 26:57.500
things, if they don't know the stories or care about that, especially why they find the ads more

26:57.500 --> 27:04.880
fascinating than anything. But I started out in the terms of serious collecting with the magazines

27:05.500 --> 27:12.780
and the pulp especially. And those early ones especially are, there just aren't very many

27:12.780 --> 27:16.300
copies around, and so that's kind of my favorite part of the collection.

27:20.360 --> 27:24.900
What kind of reactions do you get from people when they first get to know you and find out

27:24.900 --> 27:26.780
that you collect like this? Do they think you're pretty weird?

27:28.380 --> 27:35.380
Most of them are at least polite. Actually, it's fairly well known around here because a couple

27:35.380 --> 27:40.800
of years ago, the wire services got ahold of it, and I was interviewed, and there were write-ups

27:40.800 --> 27:44.840
and papers all over the state, and I just learned the other day there was actually one in Lincoln,

27:45.000 --> 27:50.780
Nebraska, and I don't know where else, as well as I appeared on local television and a few other

27:50.780 --> 27:57.500
things, so I don't make any big secret about it at least. So some people know me by, know of my

27:57.500 --> 28:05.560
reputation, oh you mean you're the guy with all those books. Is there any way for you to tell

28:06.800 --> 28:11.120
how you, I don't know, I'm sure how to put this, how you rank or how your collection stacks up

28:11.120 --> 28:18.940
against some of the other collectors around the country? Not really, I do, I have corresponded

28:18.940 --> 28:24.660
with a fair amount of collectors, and I know if I think about it, I could probably put together

28:24.660 --> 28:32.420
a dozen names or so of ones who probably have at least comparable size collections. I think that

28:32.420 --> 28:38.800
possibly for some in some libraries, I doubt they're very many or bigger. I have no real way to know

28:38.800 --> 28:43.860
that because, you know, I don't go to conventions around the country and things like that, so

28:45.180 --> 28:51.580
I need some of these people by letter, but I don't know that much. At least not very many of them do

28:51.580 --> 28:59.540
that one thing I do of collecting multiple editions of the same book. Yeah, this is another one that's

28:59.540 --> 29:06.060
sort of off the record, but I'm a Lord of the Rings bug, you know, Tolkien fan, and I recently

29:06.060 --> 29:11.760
found a set of the Ace Lord of the Rings books and paperback. Are they worth much?

29:12.600 --> 29:20.180
Depending on condition, I think that the market price for nice copies probably in the range of

29:20.180 --> 29:30.200
ten bucks. Ten bucks each? Yeah, I'm not sure, I haven't really seen anybody list one very recently.

29:31.120 --> 29:35.220
It could be more. That's what I pay ten bucks each, and they were in good condition.

29:35.920 --> 29:39.420
What? That was pretty good estimate on your part.

29:39.420 --> 29:48.520
Okay. Well, listen, John, is there, like I said, I don't know a great deal about collecting, so...

29:48.520 --> 29:51.760
You've been asking a good question. Well, I was wondering, is there any area or anything,

29:51.940 --> 29:58.120
or you'd like to say or stuff that I'm missing? I think we pretty much cover the waterfront,

29:58.340 --> 30:04.480
as far as I can tell. Yeah, I would say so. We do have some things in common. I'm a teacher here

30:04.480 --> 30:09.120
at Odessa College. I teach English, but David and I do team teacher science fiction class.

30:09.420 --> 30:15.500
Yeah, right. That's right. So maybe sometime in the future I might give back to you. We could just

30:15.500 --> 30:20.040
talk, do a show or two on just teaching science fiction, something like that. Oh, okay. Our own

30:20.040 --> 30:26.020
approach is probably semi-smoking, at least it isn't like any of them that I've seen syllabus

30:26.020 --> 30:35.360
is on. Scullaby? Whatever it is. Yeah. Well, John, that's about all I can think of. We obviously

30:35.360 --> 30:40.120
will send you the tapes when the shows are edited. David, is there anything you want to ask me?

30:40.760 --> 30:45.000
I think I covered pretty much. I think I'd like to collect in a series or something. Yeah. Yeah.

30:45.260 --> 30:52.580
Yeah. Hey, John. Yeah. Do you know this off the record too? You know anybody who's got a copy of

30:53.200 --> 31:00.640
Zalazny's Guns of Avalon, first edition hardcover? No, I don't. Not in hardcover. Yeah. I understand

31:00.640 --> 31:06.680
that. It's pretty hard to get a hold of. It's not near as hard as Nine Princes. Oh, okay. I got the

31:06.680 --> 31:13.880
wrong one then. Oh, I see. I don't have anything except the book club editions. Okay. I'm just

31:13.880 --> 31:20.100
starting into hardbacks really, and I don't have all that much that's rare. And I certainly don't

31:20.100 --> 31:25.780
have duplicate copies. Okay. Well, listen, John, we appreciate your time. Maybe some of these days

31:25.780 --> 31:30.020
I'll get to meet you if we come to some local convention up there or something. Well, hopefully

31:30.020 --> 31:35.020
we'll have a convention here again next year. Yeah. Okay. Thank you very much,

31:35.060 --> 31:38.840
then, John. We'll get these tapes to you as soon as they're done. Okay, great. Goodbye. Bye-bye.
